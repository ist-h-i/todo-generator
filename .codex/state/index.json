        "preview": "**Release Decision**\n- Approve for release. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and align with the Angular + Tailwind + TypeScript stack in this repo. No new dependencies or build changes.\n\n**Scope of Changes**\n- Standardized native selects to the modern style with vertically centered trigger icon.\n- CSS implements the design globally; one remaining template updated for consistent class usage.\n- Files:\n  - CSS: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85` — modern select styling, caret centered via `background-position: right … center`.\n  - Template: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255` — added `app-select` to select class.\n\n**Not in Scope (By Design)**\n- No React/shadcn/Radix integration. The repo is Angular; introducing React components and `/components/ui` would add unused complexity and dependencies.\n\n**Risks**\n- Missed templates without `app-select` may look inconsistent (CSS still targets `select.form-control`, mitigating risk).\n- RTL locales anchor caret to right; not yet mirrored.\n- High-contrast/forced-colors modes may need a fallback to native indicator for visibility.\n\n**Verification Checklist**\n- Visual: All selects show centered caret, adequate right padding, consistent radius and focus ring.\n- Pages: Settings, Reports, Analyze, Board, Admin — scan visible selects for consistency.\n- States: Hover/focus rings, disabled opacity/cursor, error borders (if any).\n- Multi-selects: No chevrons; padding/layout stable.\n- Dark mode: Chevron visibility and contrast are acceptable.\n- Mobile: Touch targets ≥44px; no overflow or clipped icon.\n\n**Rollout Plan**\n- Ship as a minor UI refinement; no migrations, no config changes.\n- Communicate usage: ensure new/edited selects include `class=\"form-control app-select\"`.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n- If issues arise, revert template edits and/or temporarily disable the select-specific block in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85`.\n- No dependency removals required.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Do we need RTL support now? If yes, we will add `:dir(rtl)` overrides for caret position.\n- Any custom non-native select widgets that should also adopt this style?"

The current CSS solution satisfies the issue requirements with minimal impact."

(Repo docs mention Angular; the task requests a React component.)\n- Whether shadcn/Tailwind/TS are already configured.\n- Existing components path and alias setup (is `/components/ui` present? does `@` resolve?).\n- Presence of `@/lib/utils` and the `cn` helper.\n- Design tokens/theming parity with shadcn (colors, radius).\n- Package manager and Node version constraints.\n\n**Risks**\n\n- If the project is Angular, integrating a React component directly is non-trivial (requires wrapper/micro-frontend); scope could expand.\n- Token/class name mismatch could produce visual regressions if Tailwind config differs from shadcn defaults.\n- Replacing “all selectors” may touch many files; careful, staged adoption may be needed.\n\n**Planned Deliverables (if React stack is confirmed)**\n\n- `components/ui/select.tsx` with the provided Radix-based Select.\n- `components/ui/label.tsx` (dependency).\n- `components/ui/demo.tsx` (usage example).\n- Instructions (or changes) to ensure Tailwind, shadcn conventions, TS, alias `@`, and `@/lib/utils` exist.\n- Dependency installation: `@radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-icons`.\n\n**Clarifying Questions**\n\n- Is the frontend React/Next.js, or Angular? If Angular, do you want a React micro-frontend/embed, or an Angular-native solution instead?\n- Is Tailwind already configured? If yes, can you confirm theme tokens (ring, input, background, popover) and radius scale?\n- Do you already use shadcn’s folder convention (`/components/ui`) and alias `@` → `src`?\n- Do you have `@/lib/utils` with `cn` defined, or should I add it?\n- Icon set preference: stick with Radix icons from the spec, or switch to `lucide-react` (ChevronUp/Down/Check) to standardize icons?\n- What is the acceptance scope for “app-wide”: replace only custom select components, or also native `<select>` where safe?\n- Package manager and Node version to target (npm/yarn/pnpm; Node LTS)?"

Add logical-position rules if RTL is needed.\n- High-contrast/forced-colors mode may need a tweak to ensure caret visibility or fallback to native.\n\n**Optional Next Steps**\n\n- If you want RTL support, I can add `:dir(rtl)` overrides for the caret position.\n- If you need React/shadcn in a separate React app, I can provide a minimal setup guide and drop the provided `select.tsx`, `label.tsx`, and `demo.tsx` into `/components/ui` there."

One template was missing `app-select`, causing inconsistent spacing/centering.\n\n**No React/shadcn Change**\n- The repo is Angular + Tailwind + TypeScript (see `frontend/angular.json`, `frontend/tailwind.config.js`), not a React/shadcn setup. Integrating Radix React components isn’t applicable here.
