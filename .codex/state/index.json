Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The prior TS2341 error is fixed by making `onTouched` public.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Trigger: vertically centered simple chevron; spacing balanced; `.ui-select__trigger` suppresses background-image from global select styles.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"`, items `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`, smooth animation, `z-index: 1000`, dark theme parity, high‑contrast safeguard for the chevron icon.\n- Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down navigation, Enter to select, Escape to close; click‑outside to dismiss.\n- Minimal impact: native `<select>` retained for multi/size; global `_base.scss` keeps parity for native selects.\n\n**Issues To Address (Small, High-Value)**\n- Hidden native select remains focusable in single mode.\n  - Impact: Tab order includes an invisible control; screen reader noise and confusing focus.\n  - Fix: On the hidden select (`.ui-select__native--hidden`) add `[attr.tabindex]=\\\"-1\\\" [attr.aria-hidden]=\\\"true\\\" inert`. This keeps it in DOM for option parsing/value sync while removing it from focus and accessibility trees.\n- Keyboard polish (optional but low‑effort):\n  - Scroll active option into view when opening or moving the active index (e.g., `element.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`).\n  - Support Home/End keys to jump to first/last option.\n  - Consider `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger and `id` on options to expose the active state to AT.\n- Focus styling for options (optional):\n  - Add `.ui-select__option:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }` for clearer keyboard focus.\n- Stacking context (verify):\n  - `z-index: 1000` is likely fine; confirm it clears any app toolbars/overlays.\n\n**Security/Perf/Compat**\n- No new dependencies. CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers may lack support (already present elsewhere).\n- DOM reads are minimal; event listeners are scoped. No obvious security risks.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve with one required fix: make the hidden select unfocusable/hidden to AT in single mode.\n- Optional niceties: scroll active item into view, Home/End keys, focus-visible outline, and `aria-activedescendant`. These are small and safe enhancements if you want me to add them."

If not, do you want Tailwind added, or should we stick to SCSS tokens?\n- Do we need keyboard navigation parity (arrow keys, typeahead) and ARIA roles for the custom panel?\n- Any must-have panel features (labels, separators, groups, scroll buttons, max height, animations)?\n- Pages to verify first (e.g., Settings, Board, Reports) and any exclusions from the new style?\n- Icon style specifics for the trigger and selected/active item (size/weight, chevron only)?"

Prior work already centralized trigger styling in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss` and introduced `UiSelectComponent` under `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/`.\n- Decision: Do NOT introduce React/shadcn into the Angular app. Ship an Angular UI select with a modern custom panel and apply it where `UiSelectComponent` is used, then add light‑touch SCSS to keep native `<select>`s visually aligned.\n\nWhat we will do\n- Keep component location and styles\n  - Components: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/` (Angular shared UI).\n  - Global styles: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss` (already updated trigger).\n  - Component styles: co-located stylesheet for the custom panel (e.g., `ui-select.scss`).\n- Modernize the options panel (Angular)\n  - Panel container: rounded corners, subtle border, elevated shadow, max-height with smooth scroll, z-index above content, open/close animation.\n  - Items: spacious row height, hover/focus/active states, selected checkmark, disabled opacity, label/separator styles if present.\n  - Accessibility: `role=\"listbox\"`/`role=\"option\"`, `aria-selected`, keyboard focus state, keep or improve existing keyboard handling.\n  - Theming: light/dark parity using current tokens; no new design system required.\n- Apply component app‑wide pragmatically\n  - Ensure pages already converted to `UiSelectComponent` (Admin, Reports, any existing references) use the new panel styles.\n  - Keep native `<select>`s styled via `_base.scss` for trigger parity; the native OS dropdown remains (cannot be fully themed), which is acceptable where the custom panel is not required.\n- Fix known TS issue\n  - Ensure `ControlValueAccessor` hooks (`onTouched`) are public or invoked via a safe wrapper to avoid Angular compiler errors (TS2341).\n\nNon-goals (to keep scope minimal)\n- Do not add React/shadcn, Tailwind, or new icon packages.\n- Do not mass‑migrate every native `<select>`; focus on the shared Angular `UiSelectComponent` and leave a short migration note for future conversions.\n\nIf this were a React/shadcn project\n- Default paths: components under `/components/ui`, utilities under `/lib/utils`.\n- You’d place `select.tsx`, `demo.tsx`, and `label.tsx` into `/components/ui`, and install `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`.\n- In this Angular repo, creating `/components/ui` is not appropriate; stick to `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/`.\n\nKey implementation notes for coder\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts`: verify `ControlValueAccessor` wiring, make `onTouched` callable from template, expose open state for CSS animations if needed.\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.html` (or template): wrap the options in a positioned panel element with `role=\"listbox\"`; each option `role=\"option\"`, `aria-selected`.\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.scss`: add new panel class styles:\n  - Panel: `border-radius`, `border`, `box-shadow`, `background`, `max-height: 24rem`, `overflow: auto`, `padding`, entry/exit animations.\n  - Item: spacing, hover/focus background (`accent`), selected checkmark, disabled style, high-contrast friendly focus outline.\n  - Dark mode variants to match existing tokens.\n- `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss`: keep existing trigger improvements; optionally add a forced-colors safe fallback (hide gradient chevrons in high-contrast).\n\nOpen questions (optional)\n- Any pages that must not change?

No new dependencies or build changes.\n\n**Scope of Changes**\n- Standardized native selects to the modern style with vertically centered trigger icon.\n- CSS implements the design globally; one remaining template updated for consistent class usage.\n- Files:\n  - CSS: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85` — modern select styling, caret centered via `background-position: right … center`.\n  - Template: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255` — added `app-select` to select class.\n\n**Not in Scope (By Design)**\n- No React/shadcn/Radix integration. The repo is Angular; introducing React components and `/components/ui` would add unused complexity and dependencies.\n\n**Risks**\n- Missed templates without `app-select` may look inconsistent (CSS still targets `select.form-control`, mitigating risk).\n- RTL locales anchor caret to right; not yet mirrored.\n- High-contrast/forced-colors modes may need a fallback to native indicator for visibility.\n\n**Verification Checklist**\n- Visual: All selects show centered caret, adequate right padding, consistent radius and focus ring.\n- Pages: Settings, Reports, Analyze, Board, Admin — scan visible selects for consistency.\n- States: Hover/focus rings, disabled opacity/cursor, error borders (if any).\n- Multi-selects: No chevrons; padding/layout stable.\n- Dark mode: Chevron visibility and contrast are acceptable.\n- Mobile: Touch targets ≥44px; no overflow or clipped icon.\n\n**Rollout Plan**\n- Ship as a minor UI refinement; no migrations, no config changes.\n- Communicate usage: ensure new/edited selects include `class=\"form-control app-select\"`.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n- If issues arise, revert template edits and/or temporarily disable the select-specific block in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85`.\n- No dependency removals required.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Do we need RTL support now? If yes, we will add `:dir(rtl)` overrides for caret position.\n- Any custom non-native select widgets that should also adopt this style?"

The build error TS2341 occurred because onTouched was private when referenced by (blur)=\"onTouched()\".\n\n**Selector Design Status**\n- Centralized CSS for a modern, vertically centered single down-arrow caret is in place:\n  - Styles: frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:78\n  - Uses inline SVG chevron, padded trigger, hover/focus/disabled, multi-select, and dark mode variants.\n\n**React/shadcn Select (Prep Instructions)**\n- This repo is Angular. If/when you add a React app (e.g., Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn):\n  - Components path (shadcn convention): components/ui\n  - Add files:\n    - components/ui/select.tsx (provided Select)\n    - components/ui/label.tsx (provided Label)\n  - Ensure utility: lib/utils.ts exports cn(...)\n  - Install deps: npm i @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-icons\n  - Tailwind/shadcn setup: initialize Tailwind, shadcn CLI, and ensure tokens like bg-background, border-input are configured.\n\n**Why components/ui**\n- shadcn CLI scaffolds and docs assume components/ui, keeping primitives standardized and discoverable. It simplifies future component additions and consistency.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Build Angular to confirm: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build\n- If you want, I can add a quick safeguard to use (blur)=\"onTouched?.()\" and scan for other private members referenced in templates.\n\n**Questions**\n- Should the React Select be integrated now (in a separate React app), or just prepped for future?\n- Any RTL or legacy browser constraints for the select visuals?\n- Any modules that should retain current selector styling and be excluded?"

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The prior TS2341 error is fixed by making `onTouched` public.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Trigger: vertically centered simple chevron; spacing balanced; `.ui-select__trigger` suppresses background-image from global select styles.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"`, items `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`, smooth animation, `z-index: 1000`, dark theme parity, high‑contrast safeguard for the chevron icon.\n- Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down navigation, Enter to select, Escape to close; click‑outside to dismiss.\n- Minimal impact: native `<select>` retained for multi/size; global `_base.scss` keeps parity for native selects.\n\n**Issues To Address (Small, High-Value)**\n- Hidden native select remains focusable in single mode.\n  - Impact: Tab order includes an invisible control; screen reader noise and confusing focus.\n  - Fix: On the hidden select (`.ui-select__native--hidden`) add `[attr.tabindex]=\\\"-1\\\" [attr.aria-hidden]=\\\"true\\\" inert`. This keeps it in DOM for option parsing/value sync while removing it from focus and accessibility trees.\n- Keyboard polish (optional but low‑effort):\n  - Scroll active option into view when opening or moving the active index (e.g., `element.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`).\n  - Support Home/End keys to jump to first/last option.\n  - Consider `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger and `id` on options to expose the active state to AT.\n- Focus styling for options (optional):\n  - Add `.ui-select__option:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }` for clearer keyboard focus.\n- Stacking context (verify):\n  - `z-index: 1000` is likely fine; confirm it clears any app toolbars/overlays.\n\n**Security/Perf/Compat**\n- No new dependencies. CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers may lack support (already present elsewhere).\n- DOM reads are minimal; event listeners are scoped. No obvious security risks.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve with one required fix: make the hidden select unfocusable/hidden to AT in single mode.\n- Optional niceties: scroll active item into view, Home/End keys, focus-visible outline, and `aria-activedescendant`. These are small and safe enhancements if you want me to add them.\n"

Title suggests per-folder recipes; body suggests per-source-file documentation.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- Use the existing recipe standard in `docs/recipes/README.md` (per-file “recipe” docs with naming `docs/recipes/<relative_path with __>.recipe.md`).\n- Scope includes both backend (`backend/app/**`) and frontend Angular app (`frontend/src/**`), excluding tests and generated assets unless requested.\n- Focus on public-facing functions/classes and important variables; internal/private items documented when they materially affect behavior.\n\n**Constraints**\n- Minimize changes and churn; prefer a small, targeted set of docs or stubs that align with the existing recipe convention.\n- Fit within a 30-minute window; avoid attempting exhaustive coverage in one pass.\n- Keep consistent with the Development Governance Handbook and Angular guidelines linked in `docs/`.\n\n**Unknowns**\n- Whether “per-folder” recipes are required in addition to (or instead of) the existing per-file recipe convention.\n- Exact coverage: all files vs. selected “core” files; include tests?\n- Depth: brief summaries vs. exhaustive descriptions for every variable.\n- Priority areas (e.g., critical services, APIs, or high-churn modules).\n\n**Clarifying Questions**\n- Should we follow the current per-file recipe convention in `docs/recipes/README.md`, or create per-folder recipes (or both)?\n- Which code areas are in-scope first: backend, frontend, or both? Any priority directories?\n- Do you want to include tests and scripts, or only production code?\n- What depth is expected for “variables”: only exported/public, or all locals where relevant?\n- Is an initial set of stubs acceptable (to minimize diff), with a plan to incrementally fill details?\n\n**Risks / Impacts**\n- Exhaustive documentation of every function/variable across the repo is large and time-consuming; high risk of drift if not incrementally maintained.\n- Introducing a new per-folder pattern may conflict with the existing per-file recipe standard unless explicitly aligned."

For React projects, default paths would be `/components/ui` with Tailwind and `@/lib/utils`; not applicable here.\n\n**Optional Follow‑ups (low effort)**\n- Scroll active option into view on open/arrow navigation.\n- Add Home/End keys and `aria-activedescendant` wiring for full ARIA polish.\n\nIf you want, I can implement the active-item scroll and Home/End keys next."

Stubs include clear TODOs for owners to fill in details.\n\n**Open Questions / Risks**\n- Scope breadth: The issue title mentions “per-folder,” while the repository standard is per-file. If per-folder summaries are also desired, I can add a lightweight folder-level `RECIPE.md` convention that references per-file recipes.\n- Depth of “variables”: I currently document top-level module variables (Python) and exported variables (TypeScript). If deeper coverage (e.g., class fields, method params) is required, the parser can be extended.\n- If you want me to run the generator repo-wide and add all missing recipes now, I can do that next."

(Optional class/interface documentation can be added later, but not required now.)\n\nWhy this is minimal\n- One script + generated markdown files; no external deps, no build/toolchain changes.\n- Idempotent generation to minimize churn; incremental updates easy.\n- Avoids introducing a competing per-file recipe convention.\n\nRisks / Open Questions\n- Regex extraction may miss edge cases (e.g., re-exports, multi-line exports). Acceptable for initial pass; can refine later.\n- Depth: We will scaffold entries with TODO description placeholders; subject-matter owners can fill details incrementally.\n- Scope ambiguity (“each folder”): Planning assumes folders under `frontend/src/app/**`; backend or scripts don’t exist here.\n- Drift risk: Recommend re-running generator in CI or pre-commit later, if desired.\n\nExecution Steps (high level)\n- Implement generator script with directory traversal and export parsing.\n- Generate initial `RECIPE.md` files for all folders in scope.\n- Add a concise guide at `docs/recipes/README.md` with template and usage.\n- Keep the diff small and focused on docs and one script.\n\nStage Selection\n- Choose coder only. The change is self-contained, low-risk, and does not require extra QA or release steps. A code quality pass is optional but not essential for a single script and markdown output.\n\nTests / Validation\n- Run the generator; verify:\n  - A few representative folders (e.g., `frontend/src/app/core/api`, `frontend/src/app/features/board`) have `RECIPE.md` with exported functions/variables listed and placeholders for descriptions.\n  - Idempotency: running the script twice doesn’t change output absent code changes.\n  - No files created outside intended folders; no changes to `.spec.ts` handling.\n\n```json\n{\"steps\":[\"coder\"],\"notes\":\"Adopt per-folder RECIPE.md convention under frontend/src/app/**. Implement a small Node script to parse exported functions/variables from .ts files (excluding tests) and generate RECIPE.md per folder. Seed docs and add a brief guide at docs/recipes/README.md.
