Create it to keep shadcn-generated imports consistent.\n  - Install: `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`.\n  - Add `select.tsx` and `demo.tsx` under `/components/ui`, and `label.tsx` (from “originui/label”) under `/components/ui/label.tsx`.\n  - Ensure Tailwind and Typescript are set up; shadcn CLI scaffolds typical structure.\n- For this Angular repo, the equivalen"

Suggest hiding it in forced-colors and relying on native affordances.\n- RTL: rules use physical `right`; acceptable for now, but logical properties could be a follow-up if RTL is required.\n- If `color-mix()` is used anywhere for subtle tints, ensure acceptable browser support or add a conservative fallback.\n\n**Lightweight Suggestions (Optional)**\n- Add a11y safeguard:\n  - `@media (forced-colors: active) { .app-select, select.form-control { background-image: none; } }` in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:225` (or nearby global select rules).\n\n**Notes on React/shadcn Instructions**\n- This repo is Angular; introducing React/shadcn and Radix would violate minimal-change constraints. The centralized Angular/SCSS solution already satisfies the requirements.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve. The implementation is correct, minimal, and resolves the reported issues. Optional a11y tweak can be a small follow-up if desired."

No new dependencies or build changes.\n\n**Scope of Changes**\n- Standardized native selects to the modern style with vertically centered trigger icon.\n- CSS implements the design globally; one remaining template updated for consistent class usage.\n- Files:\n  - CSS: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85` — modern select styling, caret centered via `background-position: right … center`.\n  - Template: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255` — added `app-select` to select class.\n\n**Not in Scope (By Design)**\n- No React/shadcn/Radix integration. The repo is Angular; introducing React components and `/components/ui` would add unused complexity and dependencies.\n\n**Risks**\n- Missed templates without `app-select` may look inconsistent (CSS still targets `select.form-control`, mitigating risk).\n- RTL locales anchor caret to right; not yet mirrored.\n- High-contrast/forced-colors modes may need a fallback to native indicator for visibility.\n\n**Verification Checklist**\n- Visual: All selects show centered caret, adequate right padding, consistent radius and focus ring.\n- Pages: Settings, Reports, Analyze, Board, Admin — scan visible selects for consistency.\n- States: Hover/focus rings, disabled opacity/cursor, error borders (if any).\n- Multi-selects: No chevrons; padding/layout stable.\n- Dark mode: Chevron visibility and contrast are acceptable.\n- Mobile: Touch targets ≥44px; no overflow or clipped icon.\n\n**Rollout Plan**\n- Ship as a minor UI refinement; no migrations, no config changes.\n- Communicate usage: ensure new/edited selects include `class=\"form-control app-select\"`.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n- If issues arise, revert template edits and/or temporarily disable the select-specific block in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85`.\n- No dependency removals required.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Do we need RTL support now? If yes, we will add `:dir(rtl)` overrides for caret position.\n- Any custom non-native select widgets that should also adopt this style?"

The build error TS2341 occurred because onTouched was private when referenced by (blur)=\"onTouched()\".\n\n**Selector Design Status**\n- Centralized CSS for a modern, vertically centered single down-arrow caret is in place:\n  - Styles: frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:78\n  - Uses inline SVG chevron, padded trigger, hover/focus/disabled, multi-select, and dark mode variants.\n\n**React/shadcn Select (Prep Instructions)**\n- This repo is Angular. If/when you add a React app (e.g., Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn):\n  - Components path (shadcn convention): components/ui\n  - Add files:\n    - components/ui/select.tsx (provided Select)\n    - components/ui/label.tsx (provided Label)\n  - Ensure utility: lib/utils.ts exports cn(...)\n  - Install deps: npm i @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-icons\n  - Tailwind/shadcn setup: initialize Tailwind, shadcn CLI, and ensure tokens like bg-background, border-input are configured.\n\n**Why components/ui**\n- shadcn CLI scaffolds and docs assume components/ui, keeping primitives standardized and discoverable. It simplifies future component additions and consistency.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Build Angular to confirm: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build\n- If you want, I can add a quick safeguard to use (blur)=\"onTouched?.()\" and scan for other private members referenced in templates.\n\n**Questions**\n- Should the React Select be integrated now (in a separate React app), or just prepped for future?\n- Any RTL or legacy browser constraints for the select visuals?\n- Any modules that should retain current selector styling and be excluded?"

Examples:\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/App.recipe.md`\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/core/profile/ProfileService.recipe.md`\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/features/board/BoardPage.recipe.md`\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/UiSelectComponent.recipe.md`\n\n**影響**\n- Docs-only change; no code, build, or runtime impact.\n- Enables consistent, per-class documentation with a mirrored docs path.\n- Safe to re-run the generator; no churn due to idempotency.\n\n**検証**\n- Generate recipes: `python scripts/generate_class_recipes.py`\n- Re-run to confirm idempotency (no new files on second run).\n- Sanity-check coverage:\n  - Count classes: `rg -n \"^\\s*export\\s+(default\\s+)?class\\s+\\w+\" frontend/src/app | wc -l`\n  - Count recipes: `find docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app -type f -name \"*.recipe.md\" | wc -l`\n- Spot-check created examples to confirm structure and public API listing:\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/core/logger/Logger.recipe.md`\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/features/reports/ReportAssistantPageComponent.recipe.md`\n\n**レビュー観点**\n- Convention alignment: Per-class under `docs/recipes/classes/` matches user preference; avoids cluttering source.\n- Coverage limits: Lightweight parsing may miss rare patterns (e.g., complex multiline class declarations, `export default class`, `static` members).\n- Clarity/completeness: Stubs include sections for Purpose, Public API (methods/properties), Dependencies, Usage Notes; owners can fill details incrementally.\n- Optional improvements (small/safe):\n  - Extend parsing to capture `static` members and `export default class`.\n  - Basic `@Input/@Output` awareness for Angular components.\n- Open questions:\n  - Language depth (English-only vs bilingual JP/EN).\n  - Whether to extend beyond Angular to other areas later."

Acceptable for initial pass.\n- Dual conventions (per-file vs per-class) are both present; README already positions Angular to use per-class, backend to use per-file—keep this distinction consistent in practice.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve as delivered. No required fixes. The optional improvements above are small, safe, and would increase coverage and ergonomics."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

If it includes template `$any(...)`, plan a small follow-up to type controls/events and remove a subset incrementally.\n- Scope control: Changes are minimal and localized; no unrelated refactors or upgrades.\n- PR flow: Confirm whether to update PR #507 or open a new, focused PR summarizing the verification and documentation alignment.\n- Residual risk: Numerous `$any(...)` casts in templates remain; safe removal requires per-template typing and should be addressed in small batches."

The prior TS2341 error is fixed by making `onTouched` public.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Trigger: vertically centered simple chevron; spacing balanced; `.ui-select__trigger` suppresses background-image from global select styles.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"`, items `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`, smooth animation, `z-index: 1000`, dark theme parity, high‑contrast safeguard for the chevron icon.\n- Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down navigation, Enter to select, Escape to close; click‑outside to dismiss.\n- Minimal impact: native `<select>` retained for multi/size; global `_base.scss` keeps parity for native selects.\n\n**Issues To Address (Small, High-Value)**\n- Hidden native select remains focusable in single mode.\n  - Impact: Tab order includes an invisible control; screen reader noise and confusing focus.\n  - Fix: On the hidden select (`.ui-select__native--hidden`) add `[attr.tabindex]=\\\"-1\\\" [attr.aria-hidden]=\\\"true\\\" inert`. This keeps it in DOM for option parsing/value sync while removing it from focus and accessibility trees.\n- Keyboard polish (optional but low‑effort):\n  - Scroll active option into view when opening or moving the active index (e.g., `element.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`).\n  - Support Home/End keys to jump to first/last option.\n  - Consider `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger and `id` on options to expose the active state to AT.\n- Focus styling for options (optional):\n  - Add `.ui-select__option:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }` for clearer keyboard focus.\n- Stacking context (verify):\n  - `z-index: 1000` is likely fine; confirm it clears any app toolbars/overlays.\n\n**Security/Perf/Compat**\n- No new dependencies. CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers may lack support (already present elsewhere).\n- DOM reads are minimal; event listeners are scoped. No obvious security risks.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve with one required fix: make the hidden select unfocusable/hidden to AT in single mode.\n- Optional niceties: scroll active item into view, Home/End keys, focus-visible outline, and `aria-activedescendant`. These are small and safe enhancements if you want me to add them.\n"

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps.

By normalizing to a string array first, includes is always safe, and the logic remains consistent for both single and multi-select.\n\nKey references\n- Selection check now uses a normalized array:\n  - frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:256\n- Multiple mode label derivation already safe:\n  - frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:286\n\nImpact\n- Behavior unchanged; only safer type handling.\n- Styles and the modernized arrow/currentColor alignment remain intact.\n- Scope is a single-file, minimal change.\n\nHow to verify\n- Build: cd frontend && ng build --configuration production\n- Tests: cd frontend && npm test (Karma should start with 0 load errors)\n- Manual: Confirm selects show correct labels for single/multi, and no console errors. Dark mode arrow remains visible and matches text color.\n\nNote on React/shadcn request\n- This repo is Angular. The provided React/shadcn component path (/components/ui) doesn’t apply here. We retained the Angular shared select (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts) and centralized SCSS updates for minimal impact and full app coverage. If you need a separate React setup, I can provide a shadcn/Tailwind guide and component placement under /components/ui in a React app."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The frontend removed the nickname/email overwrite logic and prefers nickname for defaults.

Good.\n- Read‑time resolution batches ids per response; avoids N+1. Good.\n- Update and create paths canonicalize both card assignees and subtask assignee. Good.\n- Filters: server‑side `assignees` query filters by stored values (now userIds). UI appears to filter client‑side; no current breakage spotted.\n\n**Gaps / Risks**\n- Status reports still emit raw stored assignee values (now userIds):\n  - backend/app/services/status_report_presenter.py:63–92, 112–128\n  - Impact: Status report cards may display userIds instead of nicknames.\n- Display fallback might be empty when both nickname and email are empty:\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:198–203 returns “” if email missing; consider falling back to userId for non‑empty display.\n- Filtering by assignees via `GET /cards?assignees=` expects userIds now. If any external caller sends emails/nicknames, results will differ. The SPA doesn’t use this param currently, but integrations might.\n- Migration ambiguity: duplicate nicknames are skipped by design; those records remain as legacy strings until updated. Acceptable, but consider logging count for observability.\n\n**Lightweight Fixes (recommended)**\n- Resolve assignee display names in status report serialization (mirrors cards router):\n  - In backend/app/services/status_report_presenter.py, batch map card.assignees and subtask.assignee via `object_session` to nickname/email.\n  - Sketch:\n    - Import: `from sqlalchemy.orm import object_session`\n    - Collect `user_ids` from linked cards/subtasks; query users; build map like `_resolve_display_names`.\n    - Replace assignees/subtasks in `serialize_card_link` similar to `_card_read_with_display`.\n- Improve fallback in display resolution:\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:198–203: if neither nickname nor email is present, fall back to `user.id`.\n\n**Performance**\n- Per‑request batching for id→name is used; good. If usage grows, consider request‑scoped caching to avoid repeat mapping across multiple endpoints in the same request (optional).\n\n**Tests/Verificat"

Dismissal animates by sliding out to the right.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n- Placement: bottom-right fixed container; vertical stack.\n- Order: newest above older within the stack (confirm for bottom-right).\n- Entry: animated appearance; prior spec said “drop from top,” which may conflict with bottom anchoring; slide-in from right is acceptable if preferred.\n- Exit: slide-out to the right on dismissal.\n- Durations/colors:\n  - Error: persistent, red.\n  - Warning: 10s, yellow.\n  - Notice: 5s, green.\n  - System/Loading: ≥3s; loading persists until completion, blue.\n- Queue: in-memory array; ID-based control for update/dismiss.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- Angular SPA; implement as a service + a single host component.\n- No new dependencies; CSS-only animations.\n- Use existing design tokens for colors/shadows.\n- Programmatic API supports show/update/dismiss, and loading returns an ID.\n\n**Constraints**\n- Minimal changes; avoid replacing broad UI unless necessary.\n- Deliver a complete, self-contained outcome without new packages.\n\n**Unknowns**\n- Exact color/shadow tokens for severities.\n- Max visible toasts and overflow behavior.\n- Whether sticky errors need a close button.\n- A11y requirements (roles, aria-live, keyboard dismissal).\n- Hover-to-pause timers behavior.\n- Deduplication of repeated messages.\n- Interaction with existing notification mechanisms.\n\n**Clarifying questions**\n- With bottom-right placement, should new messages appear at the bottom (closest to the edge, pushing older upward) or remain “newest on top” as originally specified?\n- Entry animation preference at bottom-right: keep “drop from top,” switch to “slide-in from right,” or a subtle fade/scale-in?\n- Do sticky errors require a visible close button, or are they programmatic-only?\n- Cap visible toasts (e.g., 4) and queue the rest?\n- Any specific a11y requirements (aria-live level, roles, focus handling, keyboard dismissal)?\n- Should timers pause on hover/focus?\n- Dedup policy for identical repeated messages?\n- Any mobile safe-area padding and z-index layering constraints?\n- Should we replace or integrate with any existing notification system?\n\n**Residual risks**\n- Visual mismatch if “drop from top” is retained at bottom-right; may look odd without confirmation.\n- Persistent errors can accumulate without a close affordance.\n- Overlap risks with other bottom-anchored UI (chat widgets, FABs, nav bars) without safe-area rules."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The dark-mode arrow now matches the text color via `currentColor`, fixing visibility while keeping the change minimal and centralized."

By explicitly setting the trigger’s color to `var(--text-primary)` in dark mode, both the text and the icon adopt the same visible, high-contrast color.\n- Native `<select>` arrows are already rendered via a CSS background SVG using `currentColor` and are covered by global styles:\n  - frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85\n  - frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:164\n\n**Scope and Risk**\n\n- Scope is minimal and targeted to the shared select trigger in dark mode.\n- No logic changes, no dependency changes, no React/shadcn added (repo is Angular).\n- Existing states (hover/focus/disabled) remain unchanged.\n\n**How to Verify**\n\n- In dark mode, check any screen using the custom select (e.g., Admin/Reports/Settings):\n  - The down-arrow inside the select trigger matches the text color and remains clearly visible.\n  - Hover/focus/disabled states look consistent.\n- For native selects (`.app-select`, `select.form-control`), confirm arrows are also visible; they inherit `currentColor` from:\n  - frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:164\n\n**Notes**\n\n- If any page intentionally changes the trigger text color, the arrow will follow (as requested: match text and icon colors)."

Switch to LR if preferred (flowchart LR).\n\n  %% Level 1 (A): Things to do / Can't do / Want to do\n  subgraph A[\"Level 1 – Actions & Constraints (Do / Can't / Want)\"]\n    %% Uncomment and edit actual items:\n    %% A1[\"Do: <text>\"]\n    %% A2[\"Can't: <text>\"]\n    %% A3[\"Want: <text>\"]\n  end\n\n  %% Level 2 (B, C)\n  subgraph B[\"Level 2 – Inhibitors\"]\n    %% B1[\"<inhibitor>\"]\n    %% B2[\"<inhibitor>\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph C[\"Level 2 – Shadow Goals / Ideals / Goals\"]\n    %% C1[\"<shadow goal / ideal>\"]\n    %% C2[\"<goal>\"]\n  end\n\n  %% Level 3 (D, E, F)\n  subgraph D[\"Level 3 – Deep Psychology / Bias (causing B)\"]\n    %% D1[\"<deep cause / bias>\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph E[\"Level 3 – True Needs (from B & C)\"]\n    %% E1[\"<true need>\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph F[\"Level 3 – Fundamental Fixed Concepts (from C)\"]\n    %% F1[\"<fixed concept>\"]\n  end\n\n  %% Edges (add only when both referenced nodes exist):\n  %% A1 --> B1\n  %% A1 --> C1\n  %% A2 --> B2\n  %% A3 --> C2\n  %% B1 --> D1\n  %% B1 --> E1\n  %% C1 --> E1\n  %% C1 --> F1\n```\n\nWhy this fits constraints\n- Single-file, documentation-only change; no code or build impact.\n- Renders in Mermaid Live Editor immediately.\n- Hides empty nodes/edges because nothing is uncommented by default.\n- Clear mapping of edges as required: A→B, A→C, B→D, B→E, C→E, C→F.\n\nOpen Questions\n- Keep letters A–F visible in subgraph titles? (Current template shows them in subgraph names only.)\n- Preferred direction: TD (current) vs LR.\n- Do you want a link added in docs/INDEX.md for discoverability? (Would add one more small change.)\n- Should we deprecate mentions of “Why-Why analysis” in docs/features/analytics-insights/requirements.md now, or in a later pass?\n\nRisks\n- Empty subgraphs still display their labeled headers; requirement focuses on nodes/edges, which this template hides by default. If full invisibility of empty groups is required, we’d need conditional generation (out of scope for Mermaid alone).\n- Existing references to 5 Whys remain; not changing them keeps scope minimal but may cause inconsistency until follow-up.\n\nValidation\n- Paste the snippet into Mermaid Live Editor; confirm it renders.\n- Uncomment a minimal pair like A1, B1, C1 and corresponding edges; confirm layout and connections render as expected.\n- Confirm that leaving any item commented omits its node/edge.\n\n```json\n{\"steps\":[\"coder\"],\"notes\":\"One-file documentation update: add docs/analysis/immune-map.md with a ready-to-render Mermaid Immunity Map template. No other files changed to minimize scope. Template uses commented example nodes/edges so only contentful items are shown, satisfying the hide-empty requirement.\",\"tests\":\"Manual: 1) Open Mermaid Live Editor and paste the snippet; verify it renders with empty groups only. 2) Uncomment A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1 progressively and add edges A1->B1, A1->C1, B1->D1, B1->E1, C1->E1, C1->F1; verify edges render correctly. 3) Re-comment nodes/edges to confirm they disappear without errors.\"}\n```"

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The dark-mode arrow now matches the text color via `currentColor`, fixing visibility while keeping the change minimal and centralized."

If yes, who is authorized and how is it audited?\n- How should we migrate currently shared cards/boards where multiple users have access?\n- What is the expected default for new users (auto-create private channel name/visibility)?\n- Do we need a UI channel selector in card create/list now, or can we defer?\n- Are notifications or audit logs required for invite/leave/kick events?"

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps.

The dark-mode arrow now matches the text color via `currentColor`, fixing visibility while keeping the change minimal and centralized."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

Note `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` may affect analytics reliant on referrers.\n- Ops: HSTS effective only over HTTPS; COOP/CORP restrict cross-origin interactions (appropriate for APIs).\n\n**検証**\n- Targeted test: `pytest -q backend/tests/test_security_headers.py::test_api_sets_security_headers_on_healthcheck`\n- Full backend: `pytest -q backend/tests`\n- Manual spot-check (optional): `curl -s -D - http://localhost:<port>/health | grep -E 'Strict-Transport|Content-Type-Options|Referrer-Policy|X-Frame-Options|Permissions-Policy|Cross-Origin'`\n- Files to review:\n  - `backend/app/main.py:156`\n  - `backend/tests/test_security_headers.py:1`\n  - `docs/security-review.md`\n\n**レビュー観点**\n- Confirm middleware placement post-CORS and use of `setdefault` (no header clobbering).\n- Validate header names/values match policy, especially HSTS max-age and `Permissions-Policy` directives.\n- Ensure `GET /health` exists and test uses established fixtures/patterns in this repo.\n- Environment check: Production runs HTTPS so HSTS is meaningful; no flows depend on referrer headers.\n- Residual risks (deferred by design): SPA tokens in `localStorage` (recommend httpOnly cookies later), CSP on SPA host, dependency CVE audits pending due to restricted network."

Implementation is correct, minimal, and preserves existing headers via setdefault.\n- Tests validate headers on GET /health using existing fixture patterns; consistent with repo style.\n- Documentation updated to reflect actual crypto state (hardened with Fernet + legacy auto-rotate) and correct secret masking behavior.\n\nWhat I Reviewed\n- backend/app/main.py: Security headers middleware\n  - Correctly after CORS preflight middleware; non-OPTIONS responses get:\n    - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains\n    - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n    - Referrer-Policy: no-referrer\n    - X-Frame-Options: DENY\n    - Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()\n    - Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin\n    - Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin\n  - Uses response.headers.setdefault to avoid clobbering upstream values.\n  - OPTIONS handling is harmless even if preflight short-circuits earlier.\n- backend/tests/test_security_headers.py: Focused header assertions\n  - Aligns with existing TestCase/assertTrue style used elsewhere.\n  - Leverages standard TestClient fixture from backend/tests/conftest.py.\n- Crypto and secrets utilities (sanity check):\n  - backend/app/utils/crypto.py implements Fernet with legacy auto-rotation. Tests cover re-encryption and error cases.\n  - backend/app/utils/secrets.py masking logic protects short secrets; tests confirm.\n\nTiny Nits / Edge Cases\n- The middleware’s OPTIONS branch delegates to downstream middleware; it’s fine given the earlier preflight middleware, but could return early for symmetry. No change needed.\n- Referrer-Policy: no-referrer is strict. If any flow relies on referrers, consider strict-origin-when-cross-origin in a later pass.\n\nApplied Fixes\n- docs/security-review.md\n  - Replaced outdated “Weak secret storage cipher” with “Secret storage (Hardened)” describing Fernet + legacy rotation path.\n  - Updated “Secret hint” section to reflect current, safe masking behavior.\n  - Scope-limited doc edits only; no runtime impact.\n\nResidual Risks\n- HSTS requires HTTPS in production to be effective.\n- COOP/CORP are safe for APIs; keep an eye on any cross-origin embedding needs.\n- SPA tokens remain in localStorage; migration to secure, httpOnly cookies is still recommended in a future coordinated cycle.\n\nValidation\n- Suggest running: pytest -q backend/tests/test_security_headers.py::test_api_sets_security_headers_on_healthcheck\n- Full suite: pytest -q backend/tests (tests appear self-contained and should not require network)."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Keyboard and ARIA behavior remain intact.\n\nWhy this fixes “Level” options\n- The admin “レベル” field uses projected static options: frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129–132\n- With deferred read + MutationObserver, the component now consistently discovers those options even when rendering timing varies, so the dropdown shows items and selection persists.\n\nKey file references\n- Shared select: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:205, 219, 233\n- Admin “レベル”: frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129–132\n- Default value (junior): frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.ts:81, 242\n\nManual verification\n- Admin → コンピテンシー登録:\n  - Open “レベル” dropdown; see “初級 (3段階)” and “中級 (5段階)”.\n  - Select both values; submit; payload includes selected level.\n- Spot-check other selects (reports/status, priority, and admin evaluation selects) for populated options and selection.\n- Optional commands (if deps are installed):\n  - cd frontend && npm run lint\n  - cd frontend && npm start\n\nResidual risks / open questions\n- If options are API-driven and return empty, UI will still show none (backend issue).\n- If labels depend on i18n and keys are missing, labels could be blank despite this fix.\n- In SSR/hydration contexts, MutationObserver should only run in the browser; current SPA views are client-only, but SSR views should be sanity-checked."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

Current work does not change sorting semantics.\n- Edge cases: Nickname identical to email will display that same value; confirm if alternate formatting is desired.\n- Data limits: Comments from API include `author_nickname` but not `author_email`; older comments cannot fall back to email unless backend adds it.\n\n残課題・リスク（明示）\n- Bypass risk if future components read `user.nickname` directly instead of `getDisplayName`.\n- Comments fallback limited by API fields; email-based fallback not possible for historical comments.\n- Potential ambiguity where email is expected for disambiguation in support/admin contexts; verify UX expectations per screen."

Email is still shown in metadata line, which is acceptable for contexts explicitly showing email.\n\n- Workspace state and comments:\n  - frontend/src/app/core/state/workspace-store.ts:742 computes `activeUserNickname` with `getDisplayName` to keep default-assignee and current-user naming in sync.\n  - frontend/src/app/core/state/workspace-store.ts:749 `commentAuthorName` uses `getDisplayName(this.auth.user())`, falling back to ‘匿名ユーザー’ if not authenticated.\n  - Comment lists display `comment.authorNickname` (from API); when creating comments locally, the prefill follows the same nickname-first rule via `commentAuthorName`.\n\n- Admin/auth remain email-centric:\n  - Admin user selection and user list present emails (e.g., frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:295, 321), aligned with “do not change explicitly email contexts.”\n  - Auth pages use email fields only.\n\nNo changes needed\n- The scoped helper exists and is used in the shell header and workspace store as planned.\n- Behavior matches acceptance criteria, including whitespace-trim fallback and consistent use for current user display and comment author prefill.\n\nResidual risks / open questions\n- Comments from the API only include `author_nickname`/`author_id` (no `author_email`), so existing comments can’t fall back to email unless the backend adds it.\n- Sorting/search policies by “name” are not adjusted; lists might still sort on email strings where present.\n- Admin tables intentionally show email; confirm if there are any admin views that should display nickname alongside email.\n- Edge case where a user’s nickname equals their email will display that value unchanged; confirm if alternate formatting is desired.\n\nCommands to run\n- None required.

Implementation is correct, minimal, and preserves existing headers via setdefault.\n- Tests validate headers on GET /health using existing fixture patterns; consistent with repo style.\n- Documentation updated to reflect actual crypto state (hardened with Fernet + legacy auto-rotate) and correct secret masking behavior.\n\nWhat I Reviewed\n- backend/app/main.py: Security headers middleware\n  - Correctly after CORS preflight middleware; non-OPTIONS responses get:\n    - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains\n    - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n    - Referrer-Policy: no-referrer\n    - X-Frame-Options: DENY\n    - Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()\n    - Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin\n    - Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin\n  - Uses response.headers.setdefault to avoid clobbering upstream values.\n  - OPTIONS handling is harmless even if preflight short-circuits earlier.\n- backend/tests/test_security_headers.py: Focused header assertions\n  - Aligns with existing TestCase/assertTrue style used elsewhere.\n  - Leverages standard TestClient fixture from backend/tests/conftest.py.\n- Crypto and secrets utilities (sanity check):\n  - backend/app/utils/crypto.py implements Fernet with legacy auto-rotation. Tests cover re-encryption and error cases.\n  - backend/app/utils/secrets.py masking logic protects short secrets; tests confirm.\n\nTiny Nits / Edge Cases\n- The middleware’s OPTIONS branch delegates to downstream middleware; it’s fine given the earlier preflight middleware, but could return early for symmetry. No change needed.\n- Referrer-Policy: no-referrer is strict. If any flow relies on referrers, consider strict-origin-when-cross-origin in a later pass.\n\nApplied Fixes\n- docs/security-review.md\n  - Replaced outdated “Weak secret storage cipher” with “Secret storage (Hardened)” describing Fernet + legacy rotation path.\n  - Updated “Secret hint” section to reflect current, safe masking behavior.\n  - Scope-limited doc edits only; no runtime impact.\n\nResidual Risks\n- HSTS requires HTTPS in production to be effective.\n- COOP/CORP are safe for APIs; keep an eye on any cross-origin embedding needs.\n- SPA tokens remain in localStorage; migration to secure, httpOnly cookies is still recommended in a future coordinated cycle.\n\nValidation\n- Suggest running: pytest -q backend/tests/test_security_headers.py::test_api_sets_security_headers_on_healthcheck\n- Full suite: pytest -q backend/tests (tests appear self-contained and should not require network)."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps.

        "preview": "**Summary**\nOverall implementation is close and follows existing patterns. I found and fixed three concrete issues that would have caused runtime errors or test failures:\n- Length mismatch between DB column and UI/server validation for nickname.\n- Two backend tests still registering without nickname.\n- Frontend test double for `AuthService.register` not matching the updated method signature.\n\nWhat I verified:\n- Backend accepts and persists `nickname` on register and returns it in the profile.\n- Startup migration backfills existing users’ nicknames and runs at app boot.\n- Frontend registration form includes a “ニックネーム” field, validates client-side, and sends the value.\n- Profile update flow also uses the same nickname validation style.\n\n**Fixes Applied**\n- Align nickname max length to DB column (64 chars) to avoid DB errors.\n  - backend/app/services/profile.py:1 – set max to 64\n  - frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.ts:220 – client nickname validation max 64\n  - frontend/src/app/core/profile/profile-dialog.ts:360 – profile dialog max 64\n\n- Update missed tests to include nickname on registration:\n  - backend/tests/test_admin_users.py:128, 171 – add `nickname: \"Second\"`\n\n- Fix frontend test double to match new register signature:\n  - frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.spec.ts:39 – add `nickname` to `RegisterCall`\n  - frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.spec.ts:57 – mock `register(email, password, nickname)`\n\n**Correctness & Edge Cases**\n- Registration\n  - API: `POST /auth/register` expects `{ email, password, nickname }`; missing/empty nickname returns 422 via `normalize_nickname`.\n  - Duplicate email yields 400; other validations unchanged.\n- Persistence\n  - DB column is `VARCHAR(64)` nullable; migration backfills NULL/empty with `user-{id}` ensuring non-empty values post-migration while keeping schema lenient.\n- Client/Server Validation\n  - Both sides enforce non-empty + max length 64; trimming is consistent.\n- Profile Update\n  - Uses the same max length (64) and error messaging; consistent with DB.\n\n**Readability & Consistency**\n- Reused existing error message patterns (Japanese messages) and validators. The nickname validation logic is concise and co-located with other profile validations.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n- Uniqueness: Not enforced; duplicates remain possible.\n- DB NOT NULL: Column remains nullable by schema (mitigated by backfill and required registration). If a hard guarantee is desired, consider a follow-up migration to set NOT NULL once backfill is broadly deployed.\n- Validation scope: No profanity/character-set rules; acceptable per current scope but may need refinement later.\n- SSO/social login: Not evaluated; ensure those flows also supply or prompt for nickname if they hit the same endpoint.\n- i18n/accessibility: Registration label does not visually mark “必須”; errors do communicate requirement.\n\n**File References (key changes)**\n- backend/app/services/profile.py:1\n- backend/app/routers/auth.py:1\n- backend/app/migrations.py:121, 164, 960\n- frontend/src/app/core/auth/auth.service.ts:69\n- frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.ts:1\n- frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.html:127\n- frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.spec.ts:39\n- frontend/src/app/core/profile/profile-dialog.ts:360\n- backend/tests/test_admin_users.py:128, 171\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n- Add a small server-side min length (e.g., 2) to reduce accidental single-character nicknames.\n- Propose a phased plan to enforce DB NOT NULL on `users.nickname` once backfill is safely rolled out."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

Ensure persistence, validation, and data model support; address existing users without nicknames.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- “Nickname” is a new user-profile attribute persisted server-side.\n- The field is required for new registrations.\n- Minimal UI/API changes beyond registration are preferred.\n- No immediate change to how names are displayed elsewhere unless specified.\n\n**Constraints**\n- Minimize impact and avoid unrelated refactors.\n- Deliver a self-contained, finished outcome (UI, API, data, tests).\n- Align with existing validation and i18n patterns.\n- Backward compatibility must be considered for existing APIs/clients.\n\n**Unknowns**\n- Uniqueness: Must nicknames be globally unique?\n- Validation: Allowed characters, length min/max, profanity/emoji handling.\n- Editability: Can users change nickname after signup? Frequency/rules?\n- Visibility: Publicly displayed vs internal-only.\n- Data model: Existing field (e.g., displayName/handle) vs new column?\n- Migration: Strategy for existing users lacking a nickname.\n- i18n: Final label/placeholder copy and supported locales.\n- External auth: Behavior for SSO/social login flows.\n- API contract: Field name (`nickname` vs `displayName`), request/response shape, versioning.\n\n## Clarifying questions\n- Should nicknames be unique across all users? If yes, is comparison case-insensitive and Unicode-normalized?\n- What are the validation rules (min/max length, allowed characters, profanity checks, emoji support)?\n- Can users change their nickname later? If so, are there rate limits or audit requirements?\n- Is the nickname intended to be publicly visible and used in UI, or internal only for now?\n- Do we already have a similar field (e.g., `displayName`) that should be reused instead of adding `nickname`?\n- How should we handle existing users without a nickname (migration default, prompt on next login, forced modal, or admin backfill)?\n- For SSO providers, should we prefill from provider attributes (e.g., `nickname`, `name`) and still require confirmation?\n- What is the exact API field name and where should it appear in requests/responses? Any API versioning concerns?\n- Are there accessibility or localization requirements for the new input’s label, help text, and validation messages?\n\n**Residual Risks**\n- Enforcing uniqueness or strong validation may block registrations without clear UX.\n- Divergence between client/server validation could cause inconsistent errors.\n- Migration for existing users may require user prompts and can disrupt flows.\n- Confusion if an existing “username/display name” concept already exists and overlaps with “nickname.”"

Store userIds going forward; leave unmatched values as-is to preserve data.\n  - Cards/Subtasks read path: Before returning responses for list/get/create/update, resolve display labels by mapping stored userIds to nicknames (fallback to email, then raw value). Return the label strings (nickname) in the existing `assignees`/`assignee` fields so the SPA keeps working without contract changes.\n  - Status reports: In the presenter, resolve `card.assignees` to nickname labels when serializing report card summaries (if feasible in 30 minutes); otherwise call out as follow-up risk.\n  - Migration: Add a startup migration step that scans `cards.assignees` and `subtasks.assignee` and replaces emails/nicknames with userIds when a unique match is found. Skip on ambiguity.\n- Frontend (Angular)\n  - Remove/disable the WorkspaceStore effect that overwrites assignee labels between nickname and email. If keeping defaulting, prefer nickname-only (no email fallback) to avoid regressions when nickname is missing.\n\nWhy this fits the 30-minute cap\n- No API surface changes; all transformations happen server-side within existing endpoints.\n- Thin, localized edits: cards router (create/update/list/get), subtasks endpoints, one presenter method, one Angular store effect.\n- Backfill is optional-safe and batched; skips on ambiguity.\n\nOpen questions\n- Exact fallback for unresolved userId at read-time: show raw value or a placeholder (“Unassigned”)? Proposal: show raw value to avoid data loss; “Unassigned” only when field empty.\n- Multiple assignees usage in UI: SPA currently displays a single `assignee`; we’ll continue using the first resolved nickname from the backend’s list.\n- Reports: If presenter cannot easily resolve nicknames without a session, short-term they may show raw ids. OK to defer?\n- Do we need to support searching/filtering by assignee nickname vs userId in `GET /cards`? Currently filters use strings; with server-side resolution to nickname for display only, the filter semantics may need review.\n\nResidual risks\n- Legacy records with emails/nicknames that do not match a user won’t be normalized; those will display as-is.\n- Performance: resolving nicknames could add DB lookups; mitigate by batching per response and caching within request scope.\n- Reports may still show ids if not updated; small UX inconsistency until addressed.\n- Any external integrations expecting email in `assignees` may be impacted; we’re returning nicknames for display.\n\nAcceptance alignment\n- Persist links via userId; display nickname resolved from userId.\n- Remove front-end logic that overwrites nickname/email labels.\n- Provide a safe, best-effort migration from legacy strings to userIds.\n- Maintain backward compatibility by keeping response fields stable and providing graceful fallbacks.\n\nProposed tasks (coder)\n- Backend\n  - Add helper: canonicalize-assignees (email/nickname/id → id) with DB lookups; batch resolvers for id→display-name.\n  - Cards router: apply canonicalization on create/update; resolve display names on list/get before returning.\n  - Subtasks router: apply canonicalization on create/update; resolve display names on list/get.\n  - Status report presenter: resolve `assignees` to nicknames if feasible.\n  - Migration: add `_normalize_assignees_to_user_ids(engine)` in `migrations.py` and call from `run_startup_migrations`.\n- Frontend\n  - Remove `syncDef"

The same fields exist; only values now display nicknames resolved from userIds.\n- Storage format for labels, statuses, etc. unchanged.\n\nVerification steps\n- Backend\n  - Create a user U (email X, nickname N).\n  - POST /cards with assignees [\"X\"].\n    - DB stores [\"U.id\"]; response shows assignees [\"N\"].\n  - PUT /cards/{id} with assignees [\"N\"].\n    - DB stores [\"U.id\"]; response shows [\"N\"].\n  - POST /cards/{id}/subtasks with assignee \"X\".\n    - DB stores \"U.id\"; response shows \"N\".\n  - GET /cards and GET /cards/{id} both show nickname labels; no flicker in the SPA.\n\n- Migration\n  - With legacy data: cards.assignees like [\"someone@example.com\", \"unknown\"], subtasks.assignee \"Tester\".\n  - On startup, matching emails/nicknames convert to userIds; unmatched remain as-is.\n\nSuggested commands (run locally)\n- Backend tests: \n  - python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate\n  - pip install -r requirements.txt\n  - uvicorn backend.app.main:app or pytest -q (if tests are configured)\n- Frontend sanity:\n  - No API contract changes; just rebuild the SPA normally.\n\nOpen questions\n- Filtering by assignee: current GET /cards?assignees= compares against stored values (now userIds). If the UI sends nicknames in filters, we should normalize inputs server-side; confirm expected client behavior.\n- Status reports: StatusReportPresenter currently forwards card.assignees as stored values; these will be userIds post-change. If needed, we can add the same display-name resolution there.\n\nResidual risks\n- Ambiguous nicknames during migration (same nickname across users) are skipped to avoid incorrect mapping; those entries remain as legacy strings.\n- Slight overhead per request to resolve userIds → nicknames; mitigated via per-request batching.

A best‑effort migration normalizes legacy assignee strings to userIds at startup.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Write‑time canonicalization: email/nickname/id → userId\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:105–156, 173–178 (_canonicalize_assignees/_canonicalize_single_assignee)\n- Read‑time display: userId → nickname (fallback email)\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:180–203 (_resolve_display_names)\n  - Applied consistently in list/get/create/update cards and in subtask list/create/update:\n    - list_cards: backend/app/routers/cards.py:492–520\n    - create_card: backend/app/routers/cards.py:604–680\n    - get_card: backend/app/routers/cards.py:689–699\n    - update_card: backend/app/routers/cards.py:720–758\n    - list_subtasks: backend/app/routers/cards.py:787–805\n    - create_subtask: backend/app/routers/cards.py:829–842\n    - update_subtask: backend/app/routers/cards.py:858–896\n- Data model remains minimally invasive (strings remain, values now userIds):\n  - backend/app/models.py:50–104 (Card.assignees JSON of strings)\n  - backend/app/models.py:214–242 (Subtask.assignee string)\n- Startup migration backfills legacy strings to userIds, preserving unmatched values:\n  - backend/app/migrations.py:1000–1080 (_normalize_assignees_to_user_ids)\n  - Invoked in run_startup_migrations: backend/app/migrations.py:1119–1140\n- SPA stops label flipping and prefers nickname for default assignee:\n  - frontend/src/app/core/state/workspace-store.ts:742–758, 780–816\n- API shapes unchanged; Cards API and board rendering remain compatible:\n  - frontend/src/app/core/api/cards-api.service.ts:139–171 (assignees typed as strings for display)\n\n**Correctness & Edge Cases**\n- Unique nickname handling during canonicalization and migration avoids ambiguity by skipping duplicates. Good.\n- Read‑time resolution batches ids per response; avoids N+1. Good.\n- Update and create paths canonicalize both card assignees and subtask assignee. Good.\n- Filters: server‑side `assignees` query filters by stored values (now userIds). UI appears to filter client‑side; no current breakage spotted.\n\n**Gaps / Risks**\n- Status reports still emit raw stored assignee values (now userIds):\n  - backend/app/services/status_report_presenter.py:63–92, 112–128\n  - Impact: Status report cards may display userIds instead of nicknames.\n- Display fallback might be empty when both nickname and email are empty:\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:198–203 returns “” if email missing; consider falling back to userId for non‑empty display.\n- Filtering by assignees via `GET /cards?assignees=` expects userIds now. If any external caller sends emails/nicknames, results will differ. The SPA doesn’t use this param currently, but integrations might.\n- Migration ambiguity: duplicate nicknames are skipped by design; those records remain as legacy strings until updated. Acceptable, but consider logging count for observability.\n\n**Lightweight Fixes (recommended)**\n- Resolve assignee display names in status report serialization (mirrors cards router):\n  - In backend/app/services/status_report_presenter.py, batch map card.assignees and subtask.assignee via `object_session` to nickname/email.\n  - Sketch:\n    - Import: `from sqlalchemy.orm import object_session`\n    - Collect `user_ids` from linked cards/subtasks; query users; build map like `_resolve_display_names`.\n    - Replace assignees/subtasks in `serialize_card_link` similar to `_card_read_with_display`.\n- Improve fallback in display resolution:\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:198–203: if neither nickname nor email is present, fall back to `user.id`.\n\n**Performance**\n- Per‑request batching for id→name is used; good. If usage grows, consider request‑scoped caching to avoid repeat mapping across multiple endpoints in the same request (optional).\n\n**Tests/Verificat"

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Display the user’s nickname by resolving from `userId`. Remove logic that overwrites labels from nickname to email.\n\n**Goals**\n- Persist user linkage via `userId` instead of email/nickname strings.\n- Show assignee labels using the resolved user nickname.\n- Eliminate post-processing that overwrites labels with email.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- There is a canonical Users source exposing `userId`, `email`, and `nickname`.\n- `userId` is stable/unique and suitable as a foreign key.\n- Existing objects (e.g., Card, Task) currently store assignee as a string (email or nickname).\n- The SPA (Angular) renders assignee labels from object fields presently.\n- Backend and/or state management can resolve a user by `userId`.\n- Nicknames may change over time; resolving at read-time is acceptable.\n\n**Constraints**\n- Minimize scope and avoid unrelated refactors.\n- Deliver a complete, self-contained change (models, persistence, API/contracts, UI).\n- Maintain backward compatibility or provide a safe one-time migration for existing data.\n- Follow repo governance and Angular guidelines when touching SPA code.\n\n**Unknowns**\n- Exact entities/fields storing user info as strings (e.g., `Card.assignee`, `Task.owner`).\n- Source of truth for Users (DB table, API endpoint, cache).\n- Type/format of `userId` (UUID, numeric, string).\n- Whether multiple assignees are supported anywhere.\n- Current API contracts: do they already include `userId`?\n- Required handling when `userId` cannot be resolved to a user (deleted/disabled users).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- All relevant objects use `userId` for user linkage.\n- UI shows nickname resolved from `userId`.\n- Logic that overwrites nickname with email is removed.\n- Migration path exists for legacy records (email/nickname → userId).\n- Tests or verifiable steps cover resolution and fallback behavior.\n\n**Residual Risks**\n- Data migration mismatches (emails without corresponding users).\n- Performance regressions if nickname resolution adds extra calls without caching/batching.\n- UI/state bugs if `userId` resolution fails; need clear fallback strategy.\n- External integrations relying on email strings may break if not coordinated.\n\n## Clarifying questions\n- Which exact models and fields currently store user data as strings (list all: names and locations)?\n- What is the canonical Users interface and its fields (id, email, nickname)? API paths?\n- What is the `userId` type and validation rules?\n- Do any views or APIs require email display alongside nickname?\n- Should we resolve nickname server-side (embed in payload) or client-side (SPA fetch/selector)?\n- What is the fallback if `userId` is unresolved (show email, placeholder, or “Unassigned”)?\n- Is there any multi-assignee or watcher concept that needs the same change?\n- Are there migration windows/constraints (e.g., zero-downtime, versioned API compatibility)?"

This resolves the “no options/empty label” perception on init.\n- Options are built from projected `<option>` nodes and kept up to date via `MutationObserver`, with label sync after updates: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:216, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:220.\n- Selection logic is normalized for both single and multiple; label derives from current options and selected values: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:323.\n- Click, keyboard, and change paths maintain internal/native sync and propagate changes to the form control: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:266, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:293, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:362.\n\n**Readability**\n- The component maintains a clean separation of concerns: option reading, value/label sync, and UI event handling.\n- Public `onTouched` is clearly annotated for template usage; other callbacks are private and typed.\n- Template and styles are cohesive; comments succinctly document intent.\n\n**Edge Cases**\n- Multiple select: `writeValue` selects matching native options; label shows joined labels: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:247, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:331.\n- No options: active index defaults to 0; guarded usage prevents crashes, though -1 could be a cleaner sentinel (see suggestion).\n- Async option population: deferred initial read and observer-based updates handle late-projected options without console errors.\n\n**Usages Checked**\n- All current usages correctly project `<option>` children:\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:218\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:231\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:423\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:274\n- Placeholders are provided where needed; no refactor to a different API is required.\n\n**Risks / Open Questions**\n- Inert support on the hidden native select is broadly available, but older browsers may behave inconsistently. If issues arise, consider removing `inert` and rely on `aria-hidden` + styling.\n- No support for optgroups or custom templating beyond simple `<option disabled>`; confirm that’s acceptable for all current use cases.\n- For values not present in options (e.g., persisted “unknown” model), the label renders empty until the option appears. Current settings often inject an explicit `<option>` for the saved value (admin model picker), which is good.\n\n**Suggestions (Non-blocking)**\n- Consider setting `activeIndex` to -1 when `options.length === 0` for semantic clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:347.\n- Add `aria-labelledby` on the panel, pointing to the trigger, and optionally `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger when open for slightly improved a11y.\n- In `onDocClick`, rename `host` to `target` for clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:355.\n\nOverall, the implementation is correct, minimal, and aligns with existing usage patterns. No further call-site changes are needed."

Update all usages to pass options in the correct way expected by the component so they display properly.\n\n**Observed Problem**\n- Example shows `<option>` children inside `<app-ui-select>`, but they don’t appear. Likely the component doesn’t project `<option>` content or expects an input (e.g., `[options]`) instead.\n\n**Goal**\n- Ensure all `app-ui-select` instances render options correctly and integrate with forms (e.g., `formControlName`) without breaking existing behavior.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- `app-ui-select` is an Angular component used within reactive forms.\n- The component either:\n  - expects an input like `[options]` with `{ label, value }[]`, or\n  - needs `<ng-content>`/`<ng-content select=\"option\">` to support child `<option>` elements (currently missing).\n- The fix should prioritize updating call sites if a stable input API already exists; otherwise, minimally adjust the component to support the prevalent usage pattern.\n\n**Constraints**\n- Avoid unnecessary changes; keep impact minimal.\n- Deliver a complete, self-contained fix across all usages of `app-ui-select`.\n- Maintain existing UI/UX and form bindings.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- All `app-ui-select` usages display the intended option list.\n- Form bindings (`ngModel`/`formControlName`) continue to work.\n- No console errors or template binding warnings.\n- Option labels/values match current expectations (e.g., “初級 (3段階)” for `junior`).\n\n**Potential Approaches (for planner)**\n- If component already supports `[options]`: refactor all usages to pass an options array and remove child `<option>` tags.\n- If not: add content projection support to `app-ui-select` to render child `<option>` elements with correct selection/value propagation.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n- Unknown correct API of `app-ui-select` (does it support `[options]`, content projection, or both?).\n- Whether any usages rely on complex option templates (icons, tooltips) requiring `ng-template` support.\n- i18n handling for option labels—are labels hardcoded or pulled from translations?\n- Existence of disabled/optgroup/multiple-select requirements not shown in the example.\n\n**Clarifying Questions**\n- What is the intended API for `app-ui-select`: input-based options, content projection of `<option>`, or both?\n- Do we need to support advanced features (disabled options, groups, custom templates, multiple selection)?\n- Are there project-wide translation keys for these labels, or should we preserve current static strings?\n- Should we change the component or only update call sites to the intended API?\n- Can you confirm all locations where `app-ui-select` is used, or should we search the codebase comprehensively?"

Introducing React/shadcn and Radix would be high-impact and outside the “minimal change” constraint.\n- If you were integrating in a React + shadcn + Tailwind + TS app:\n  - Default components path: `/components/ui` (create it to keep shadcn imports consistent).\n  - Add `components/ui/select.tsx` and `components/ui/demo.tsx` from your snippet; add `components/ui/label.tsx` from “originui/label”.\n  - Install: `@radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-icons`.\n  - Ensure Tailwind and TS are configured; shadcn CLI scaffolds typical structure.\n\n**Optional (low risk)**\n- High-contrast mode: hide background-image chevron for native selects.\n  - Add to `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss`: `@media (forced-colors: active) { .app-select, select.form-control { background-image: none; } }`\n\nIf any specific page still shows a white hover or missing icon, point me to the file/path and I’ll align that instance.\n"

String(this.value) : '';\n        }\n      }\n      this.syncLabelFromValue();\n    }\n\nWhy\n- All current usages already project <option> children into app-ui-select, e.g.:\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129, :218, :231, :423\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255, :274\n- The component builds its option list from the native select. Without reflecting initial form control values into the native select, the label/options sync could appear empty or stale, leading to “no options” being perceived in the UI. The patch keeps the native select state aligned on initialization and when programmatic updates occur.\n\nNo Call-Site Changes Needed\n- The existing usage pattern with projected <option> is correct for this component. No templates were modified.\n\nHow to Validate\n- Click each app-ui-select and verify the dropdown panel contains expected options:\n  - Admin > コンピテンシー登録: レベル shows 初級/中級 and selects properly.\n  - Admin > 手動判定: 対象ユーザ/コンピテンシー show dynamic lists and selection updates form values.\n  - Admin > Gemini API キー: 利用モデル list shows saved/known models; selection persists.\n  - Reports > 提案編集: ステータス and 優先度 show correct options; selection persists.\n- Confirm no console/template errors appear.\n\nResidual Risks / Open Questions\n- If any view relies on advanced option features (optgroup/custom templates), current implementation doesn’t support them; scope here is single-select with disabled/multiple/basic options.\n- Cross‑browser inert support is generally good, but if a legacy browser behaves oddly, removing inert from the hidden native select could be a fallback."

This is low-risk and ensures the custom panel shows the correct selection.\n- Usages: Keep using <option> children. Add placeholder option where empty selection is valid (already present in most places). No refactor to an [options] API to minimize scope.\n\nWhy this route fits 30 minutes\n- The codebase already aligns to the intended usage pattern; the component only needs a tiny sync improvement and a quick pass to confirm placeholders and bindings.\n- Touches are localized: one component TS file and a quick verification of 6 usage sites.\n\nResidual Risks / Open Questions\n- Cross-browser behavior of the invisible native select with projected content (should be fine; but if a specific browser blocks options rendering in a hidden select, the panel might initially have zero options).\n- If advanced option features are required (disabled, optgroup, custom template), current implementation supports disabled, not optgroups/custom templates.\n- i18n of labels: Current strings are static; if translation keys are required, this is out of scope.\n\nAcceptance Validation\n- Options are visible in the custom dropdown panel for single-selects and in the native select for multi/size variants.\n- Selecting an option updates the reactive form control and the trigger label.\n- No console/template errors.\n\n```json\n{\"steps\":[\"coder\",\"code_quality_reviewer\"],\"notes\":\"Standardize on projected <option> usage and minimally harden UiSelectComponent to reflect writeValue to the native select to ensure label/options sync.
