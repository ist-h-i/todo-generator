        "preview": "**Release Summary**\n\n- Modernized select trigger and options panel across Angular app, keeping changes minimal and scoped.\n- Global native `<select>` triggers updated; shared Angular `UiSelectComponent` now renders a custom, modern dropdown panel.\n\n**What Changed**\n\n- Global styles: modern, centered chevron and spacing for selects.\n  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1`\n- Shared Angular select component: custom panel with rounded corners, shadow, max-height + scroll, hover/selected/active states, keyboard support; fixed `onTouched` visibility.\n  - `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:1`\n\n**Scope & Compatibility**\n\n- No new dependencies; Angular-only solution.\n- Usage of `<app-ui-select>` remains the same in Admin and Reports pages.\n- Native `<select>`s retain improved trigger visuals; their OS dropdown remains by design.\n- Single-selects use the custom panel; multi/size>1 continue using native control for minimal impact.\n\n**A11y & UX**\n\n- Trigger: simple down chevron, vertically centered; comfortable right padding.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"` and `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`; keyboard navigation (ArrowUp/Down, Enter, Esc).\n- Hidden native select in single mode is unfocusable and hidden from AT (`tabindex=\"-1\"`, `aria-hidden=\"true\"`, `inert`).\n\n**Risks**\n\n- Stacking context: confirm `z-index: 1000` clears headers/overlays in all layouts.\n- CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers might lack support (pre-existing risk).\n- RTL not explicitly handled (kept minimal to meet scope).\n\n**Verification Steps**\n\n- Build: from `frontend/`, run `npm ci && npm run build` (or `ng build --configuration production`).\n- Pages to check:\n  - Admin: `frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:1`\n  - Reports: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:1`\n- Validate:\n  - Trigger chevron is centered; spacing balanced; focus-visible outline appears.\n  - Panel opens under trigger with rounded corners, subtle border, shadow, smooth entry animation.\n  - States: hover highlight, selected checkmark, disabled item styling.\n  - Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down moves active item, Enter selects, Esc closes.\n  - Long lists: scroll within the panel; max-height respected.\n  - Light/dark theme parity; no clipping; no scroll bleed.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n\n- Revert the two touched files if needed:\n  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1`\n  - `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:1`\n- Temporary disable custom panel by switching affected instances to multi/size>1 (forces native select), if a hotfix is needed without code changes.\n\n**Notes on React/shadcn Request**\n\n- Repo is Angular + SCSS; introducing React/shadcn/Tailwind would be high-impact and out of scope for minimal change.\n- If a React/shadcn project is desired elsewhere, place components under `/components/ui` and install `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`. Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

        "preview": "**Summary**\n- The custom Angular `UiSelectComponent` delivers a modern options panel: rounded corners, subtle border, elevated shadow, max-height + scroll, entry animation, clear hover/selected/disabled states, and a simple down chevron trigger.\n- Scope stays minimal and centralized (component + existing SCSS). The prior TS2341 error is fixed by making `onTouched` public.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Trigger: vertically centered simple chevron; spacing balanced; `.ui-select__trigger` suppresses background-image from global select styles.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"`, items `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`, smooth animation, `z-index: 1000`, dark theme parity, high‑contrast safeguard for the chevron icon.\n- Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down navigation, Enter to select, Escape to close; click‑outside to dismiss.\n- Minimal impact: native `<select>` retained for multi/size; global `_base.scss` keeps parity for native selects.\n\n**Issues To Address (Small, High-Value)**\n- Hidden native select remains focusable in single mode.\n  - Impact: Tab order includes an invisible control; screen reader noise and confusing focus.\n  - Fix: On the hidden select (`.ui-select__native--hidden`) add `[attr.tabindex]=\\\"-1\\\" [attr.aria-hidden]=\\\"true\\\" inert`. This keeps it in DOM for option parsing/value sync while removing it from focus and accessibility trees.\n- Keyboard polish (optional but low‑effort):\n  - Scroll active option into view when opening or moving the active index (e.g., `element.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`).\n  - Support Home/End keys to jump to first/last option.\n  - Consider `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger and `id` on options to expose the active state to AT.\n- Focus styling for options (optional):\n  - Add `.ui-select__option:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }` for clearer keyboard focus.\n- Stacking context (verify):\n  - `z-index: 1000` is likely fine; confirm it clears any app toolbars/overlays.\n\n**Security/Perf/Compat**\n- No new dependencies. CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers may lack support (already present elsewhere).\n- DOM reads are minimal; event listeners are scoped. No obvious security risks.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve with one required fix: make the hidden select unfocusable/hidden to AT in single mode.\n- Optional niceties: scroll active item into view, Home/End keys, focus-visible outline, and `aria-activedescendant`. These are small and safe enhancements if you want me to add them."

If not, do you want Tailwind added, or should we stick to SCSS tokens?\n- Do we need keyboard navigation parity (arrow keys, typeahead) and ARIA roles for the custom panel?\n- Any must-have panel features (labels, separators, groups, scroll buttons, max height, animations)?\n- Pages to verify first (e.g., Settings, Board, Reports) and any exclusions from the new style?\n- Icon style specifics for the trigger and selected/active item (size/weight, chevron only)?"

Prior work already centralized trigger styling in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss` and introduced `UiSelectComponent` under `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/`.\n- Decision: Do NOT introduce React/shadcn into the Angular app. Ship an Angular UI select with a modern custom panel and apply it where `UiSelectComponent` is used, then add light‑touch SCSS to keep native `<select>`s visually aligned.\n\nWhat we will do\n- Keep component location and styles\n  - Components: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/` (Angular shared UI).\n  - Global styles: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss` (already updated trigger).\n  - Component styles: co-located stylesheet for the custom panel (e.g., `ui-select.scss`).\n- Modernize the options panel (Angular)\n  - Panel container: rounded corners, subtle border, elevated shadow, max-height with smooth scroll, z-index above content, open/close animation.\n  - Items: spacious row height, hover/focus/active states, selected checkmark, disabled opacity, label/separator styles if present.\n  - Accessibility: `role=\"listbox\"`/`role=\"option\"`, `aria-selected`, keyboard focus state, keep or improve existing keyboard handling.\n  - Theming: light/dark parity using current tokens; no new design system required.\n- Apply component app‑wide pragmatically\n  - Ensure pages already converted to `UiSelectComponent` (Admin, Reports, any existing references) use the new panel styles.\n  - Keep native `<select>`s styled via `_base.scss` for trigger parity; the native OS dropdown remains (cannot be fully themed), which is acceptable where the custom panel is not required.\n- Fix known TS issue\n  - Ensure `ControlValueAccessor` hooks (`onTouched`) are public or invoked via a safe wrapper to avoid Angular compiler errors (TS2341).\n\nNon-goals (to keep scope minimal)\n- Do not add React/shadcn, Tailwind, or new icon packages.\n- Do not mass‑migrate every native `<select>`; focus on the shared Angular `UiSelectComponent` and leave a short migration note for future conversions.\n\nIf this were a React/shadcn project\n- Default paths: components under `/components/ui`, utilities under `/lib/utils`.\n- You’d place `select.tsx`, `demo.tsx`, and `label.tsx` into `/components/ui`, and install `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`.\n- In this Angular repo, creating `/components/ui` is not appropriate; stick to `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/`.\n\nKey implementation notes for coder\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts`: verify `ControlValueAccessor` wiring, make `onTouched` callable from template, expose open state for CSS animations if needed.\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.html` (or template): wrap the options in a positioned panel element with `role=\"listbox\"`; each option `role=\"option\"`, `aria-selected`.\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.scss`: add new panel class styles:\n  - Panel: `border-radius`, `border`, `box-shadow`, `background`, `max-height: 24rem`, `overflow: auto`, `padding`, entry/exit animations.\n  - Item: spacing, hover/focus background (`accent`), selected checkmark, disabled style, high-contrast friendly focus outline.\n  - Dark mode variants to match existing tokens.\n- `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss`: keep existing trigger improvements; optionally add a forced-colors safe fallback (hide gradient chevrons in high-contrast).\n\nOpen questions (optional)\n- Any pages that must not change? Any additional panel features like grouped options or separators needed immediately?\n- Confirm dark theme target and RTL requirements.\n\nManual tests\n- Build passes for production and dev.\n- Visual checks on Admin + Reports pages using the shared component:\n  - Panel opens aligned to trigger, with rounded corners, shadow, correct z-index, and no viewport clipping.\n  - Keyboard navigation works; focus ring visible; selected/active states clear.\n  - Long li"
