        "preview": "**Release Decision**\n- Approve for release. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and align with the Angular + Tailwind + TypeScript stack in this repo. No new dependencies or build changes.\n\n**Scope of Changes**\n- Standardized native selects to the modern style with vertically centered trigger icon.\n- CSS implements the design globally; one remaining template updated for consistent class usage.\n- Files:\n  - CSS: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85` — modern select styling, caret centered via `background-position: right … center`.\n  - Template: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255` — added `app-select` to select class.\n\n**Not in Scope (By Design)**\n- No React/shadcn/Radix integration. The repo is Angular; introducing React components and `/components/ui` would add unused complexity and dependencies.\n\n**Risks**\n- Missed templates without `app-select` may look inconsistent (CSS still targets `select.form-control`, mitigating risk).\n- RTL locales anchor caret to right; not yet mirrored.\n- High-contrast/forced-colors modes may need a fallback to native indicator for visibility.\n\n**Verification Checklist**\n- Visual: All selects show centered caret, adequate right padding, consistent radius and focus ring.\n- Pages: Settings, Reports, Analyze, Board, Admin — scan visible selects for consistency.\n- States: Hover/focus rings, disabled opacity/cursor, error borders (if any).\n- Multi-selects: No chevrons; padding/layout stable.\n- Dark mode: Chevron visibility and contrast are acceptable.\n- Mobile: Touch targets ≥44px; no overflow or clipped icon.\n\n**Rollout Plan**\n- Ship as a minor UI refinement; no migrations, no config changes.\n- Communicate usage: ensure new/edited selects include `class=\"form-control app-select\"`.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n- If issues arise, revert template edits and/or temporarily disable the select-specific block in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85`.\n- No dependency removals required.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Do we need RTL support now? If yes, we will add `:dir(rtl)` overrides for caret position.\n- Any custom non-native select widgets that should also adopt this style?"

This is fine for current usage (single-select), but multi-select would need an enhancement if used.\n\n**Quality Suggestions (Non-blocking)**\n- Multi-select sync: If multi-select will be used, update writeValue to set `selected` flags on options when `this.multiple` and value is an array. For projected options, a small ViewChild to the native select and a loop to apply `selected = array.includes(option.value)` is sufficient.\n- High contrast mode: Optionally hide the SVG chevron in forced-colors to avoid contrast issues:\n  - Add: @media (forced-colors: active) { .app-select, select.form-control { background-image: none; } }\n- Consistency: Over time, consider migrating remaining native selects (Analyze, Board, Settings) to <app-ui-select> for uniform form integration, though visuals are already consistent.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve. The component is correct, minimal, and integrates cleanly where applied. The global CSS already delivers the requested modern, centered chevron across the app. Multi-select behavior is the only noted enhancement if/when needed."

If Angular-only, should we: a) deliver an Angular Select, or b) add React via micro-frontend/custom elements?\n- Does the repository already have Tailwind, shadcn structure, and `/components/ui`?\n- Do we already have `@/lib/utils` with a `cn` helper, or should we add it?\n- Are there existing design tokens (colors/radius/spacing) to match for the Select?\n- Must we replace all existing selectors now, or stage adoption (new screens first)?\n- Any pages/components that must retain their current selector styling?\n- Do we need dark mode and RTL behavior in this iteration?\n- Is swapping Radix icons to `lucide-react` preferred, or keep Radix icons as provided?\n\n"

Creating `/components/ui` and adding React/shadcn files would not compile and adds unnecessary complexity. Keeping UI parts under `shared/ui` fits the existing architecture and minimizes impact.\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- No new NPM packages installed. React/Radix not applicable in Angular.\n- Tailwind and TypeScript are already configured (see `frontend/tailwind.config.js`, `frontend/tsconfig*.json`).\n\n**Notes & Optional Follow‑ups**\n\n- You can gradually replace remaining native `<select>` with `<app-ui-select>` for full uniformity; visuals are already consistent due to global CSS.\n- If multi-select usage expands, consider enhancing `UiSelectComponent` to sync array values into projected `<option selected>` states.\n\n**If React/shadcn Is Required Elsewhere**\n\n- Only in a React app. Then standardize components under `/components/ui`, add `select.tsx`, `label.tsx`, and a `cn` utility, and install `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`. Not recommended in this Angular repo."

Creating `/components/ui` and integrating React/Radix would not compile here and would introduce unnecessary complexity. The modern, centered chevron design is already achieved globally via `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1`.\n\n**Default Paths**\n- Components: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui` (added `select/ui-select.ts`).\n- Styles: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1` (select styles already modern with a simple down arrow).\n\n**Verification**\n- Build and smoke test screens:\n  - Reports and Admin: values bind correctly with reactive forms; focus/hover/disabled states intact; chevron is centered.\n  - Other pages (Settings, Board, Analyze) still render modern selects via global SCSS.\n- Keyboard navigation and focus ring remain visible.\n\n**Notes**\n- No new NPM packages needed.\n- Remaining selects that use manual handlers (e.g., Settings/Board) can be migrated to `<app-ui-select>` later, but visual parity is already ensured by the centralized SCSS. If desired, I can extend the component to support `[(ngModel)]` and update those pages next."
