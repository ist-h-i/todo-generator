Create it to keep shadcn-generated imports consistent.\n  - Install: `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`.\n  - Add `select.tsx` and `demo.tsx` under `/components/ui`, and `label.tsx` (from “originui/label”) under `/components/ui/label.tsx`.\n  - Ensure Tailwind and Typescript are set up; shadcn CLI scaffolds typical structure.\n- For this Angular repo, the equivalen"

Suggest hiding it in forced-colors and relying on native affordances.\n- RTL: rules use physical `right`; acceptable for now, but logical properties could be a follow-up if RTL is required.\n- If `color-mix()` is used anywhere for subtle tints, ensure acceptable browser support or add a conservative fallback.\n\n**Lightweight Suggestions (Optional)**\n- Add a11y safeguard:\n  - `@media (forced-colors: active) { .app-select, select.form-control { background-image: none; } }` in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:225` (or nearby global select rules).\n\n**Notes on React/shadcn Instructions**\n- This repo is Angular; introducing React/shadcn and Radix would violate minimal-change constraints. The centralized Angular/SCSS solution already satisfies the requirements.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve. The implementation is correct, minimal, and resolves the reported issues. Optional a11y tweak can be a small follow-up if desired."

No new dependencies or build changes.\n\n**Scope of Changes**\n- Standardized native selects to the modern style with vertically centered trigger icon.\n- CSS implements the design globally; one remaining template updated for consistent class usage.\n- Files:\n  - CSS: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85` — modern select styling, caret centered via `background-position: right … center`.\n  - Template: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255` — added `app-select` to select class.\n\n**Not in Scope (By Design)**\n- No React/shadcn/Radix integration. The repo is Angular; introducing React components and `/components/ui` would add unused complexity and dependencies.\n\n**Risks**\n- Missed templates without `app-select` may look inconsistent (CSS still targets `select.form-control`, mitigating risk).\n- RTL locales anchor caret to right; not yet mirrored.\n- High-contrast/forced-colors modes may need a fallback to native indicator for visibility.\n\n**Verification Checklist**\n- Visual: All selects show centered caret, adequate right padding, consistent radius and focus ring.\n- Pages: Settings, Reports, Analyze, Board, Admin — scan visible selects for consistency.\n- States: Hover/focus rings, disabled opacity/cursor, error borders (if any).\n- Multi-selects: No chevrons; padding/layout stable.\n- Dark mode: Chevron visibility and contrast are acceptable.\n- Mobile: Touch targets ≥44px; no overflow or clipped icon.\n\n**Rollout Plan**\n- Ship as a minor UI refinement; no migrations, no config changes.\n- Communicate usage: ensure new/edited selects include `class=\"form-control app-select\"`.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n- If issues arise, revert template edits and/or temporarily disable the select-specific block in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85`.\n- No dependency removals required.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Do we need RTL support now? If yes, we will add `:dir(rtl)` overrides for caret position.\n- Any custom non-native select widgets that should also adopt this style?"

The build error TS2341 occurred because onTouched was private when referenced by (blur)=\"onTouched()\".\n\n**Selector Design Status**\n- Centralized CSS for a modern, vertically centered single down-arrow caret is in place:\n  - Styles: frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:78\n  - Uses inline SVG chevron, padded trigger, hover/focus/disabled, multi-select, and dark mode variants.\n\n**React/shadcn Select (Prep Instructions)**\n- This repo is Angular. If/when you add a React app (e.g., Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn):\n  - Components path (shadcn convention): components/ui\n  - Add files:\n    - components/ui/select.tsx (provided Select)\n    - components/ui/label.tsx (provided Label)\n  - Ensure utility: lib/utils.ts exports cn(...)\n  - Install deps: npm i @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-icons\n  - Tailwind/shadcn setup: initialize Tailwind, shadcn CLI, and ensure tokens like bg-background, border-input are configured.\n\n**Why components/ui**\n- shadcn CLI scaffolds and docs assume components/ui, keeping primitives standardized and discoverable. It simplifies future component additions and consistency.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Build Angular to confirm: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build\n- If you want, I can add a quick safeguard to use (blur)=\"onTouched?.()\" and scan for other private members referenced in templates.\n\n**Questions**\n- Should the React Select be integrated now (in a separate React app), or just prepped for future?\n- Any RTL or legacy browser constraints for the select visuals?\n- Any modules that should retain current selector styling and be excluded?"

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The prior TS2341 error is fixed by making `onTouched` public.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Trigger: vertically centered simple chevron; spacing balanced; `.ui-select__trigger` suppresses background-image from global select styles.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"`, items `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`, smooth animation, `z-index: 1000`, dark theme parity, high‑contrast safeguard for the chevron icon.\n- Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down navigation, Enter to select, Escape to close; click‑outside to dismiss.\n- Minimal impact: native `<select>` retained for multi/size; global `_base.scss` keeps parity for native selects.\n\n**Issues To Address (Small, High-Value)**\n- Hidden native select remains focusable in single mode.\n  - Impact: Tab order includes an invisible control; screen reader noise and confusing focus.\n  - Fix: On the hidden select (`.ui-select__native--hidden`) add `[attr.tabindex]=\\\"-1\\\" [attr.aria-hidden]=\\\"true\\\" inert`. This keeps it in DOM for option parsing/value sync while removing it from focus and accessibility trees.\n- Keyboard polish (optional but low‑effort):\n  - Scroll active option into view when opening or moving the active index (e.g., `element.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`).\n  - Support Home/End keys to jump to first/last option.\n  - Consider `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger and `id` on options to expose the active state to AT.\n- Focus styling for options (optional):\n  - Add `.ui-select__option:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }` for clearer keyboard focus.\n- Stacking context (verify):\n  - `z-index: 1000` is likely fine; confirm it clears any app toolbars/overlays.\n\n**Security/Perf/Compat**\n- No new dependencies. CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers may lack support (already present elsewhere).\n- DOM reads are minimal; event listeners are scoped. No obvious security risks.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve with one required fix: make the hidden select unfocusable/hidden to AT in single mode.\n- Optional niceties: scroll active item into view, Home/End keys, focus-visible outline, and `aria-activedescendant`. These are small and safe enhancements if you want me to add them.\n"

Templates contain `$any(...)` casts that are documented as discouraged.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n\n- Numerous `$any(...)` casts remain in templates. Safe replacement requires typing FormControls/event targets per template; propose incremental cleanup.\n- Acceptance criteria: If “zero any” includes template `$any`, a follow-up is needed; if limited to TS code, this meets the bar with the CVA exception.\n- Coordination with PR #507: Confirm whether to supersede or rebase; current tree already reflects the intended state.\n\n**How To Land Safely**\n\n- Open a short “confirm and document” PR or update PR #507 with a summary that no further code changes were needed and that docs and lint rules are in place.\n- Note the CVA exception and the future effort to reduce `$any(...)` in templates.\n\n**Validation Commands**\n\n- Scan for explicit any in TypeScript:\n  - rg -n \"\\bany\\b\" -S -t ts\n- Frontend lint/build/tests:\n  - cd frontend && npm run lint\n  - cd frontend && npm run build\n  - cd frontend && npm test -- --watch=false\n\nIf you want, I can scope a minimal follow-up to replace a small set of `$any(...)` casts in one feature template with typed controls."

I did not apply any patch to avoid unnecessary churn.\n\nValidation Commands\n- Search for any in TS (excludes templates):\n  - rg -n \"\\bany\\b\" frontend/src --type-add 'ts:*.ts' -t ts -S | rg -v \"\\.html:\"\n- Lint/build/tests:\n  - cd frontend && npm run lint\n  - cd frontend && npm run build\n  - cd frontend && npm test -- --watch=false\n\nResidual Risks / Open Questions\n- Template `$any(...)` casts remain. Safe removal requires typing FormControls and event targets per template; recommend incremental cleanup.\n- Acceptance criteria: If “zero any” applies to TS code only, this meets it (with the framework-required exception). If it includes template `$any`, that needs a broader follow-up.\n- Confirm whether to base on or supersede PR #507; current tree appears consistent with the planned changes.\n\nIf you want, I can scope and remove a small batch of `$any(...)` casts in one feature template as a follow-up with minimal diff."

ESLint already has `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: \"error\"`.\n\nPlan\n- Tight code fix: Replace `value: any` with a safe union type; keep `writeValue(obj: any)` because Angular ControlValueAccessor requires it.\n- Enforce lint: Add a file-scoped ESLint override for `ui-select.ts` so `writeValue` doesn’t violate the rule.\n- Docs alignment: Update Angular guidelines to clarify “no explicit any” with `unknown` preference, generics, and template `$any` guidance. Update governance handbook with a narrow CVA exception.\n\nChanges made (targeted)\n- frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts: Typed `value` as `string | string[] | null` and cast in `writeValue` to avoid leaking any internally.\n- frontend/.eslintrc.cjs: Added file-level override to disable `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` only for `src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts` to permit `ControlValueAccessor.writeValue(obj: any)`.\n- docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md: Clarified no-explicit-any policy, use of `unknown` and generics, and discouraged `$any(...)` in templates except as a narrow, temporary bridge.\n- docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md: Noted the ControlValueAccessor `writeValue(obj: any)` exception and recommended handling via ESLint file override.\n\nRisks / Open Questions\n- Template `$any(...)` casts remain; replacing them safely would exceed the 30-minute window. They are called out in guidelines as discouraged and should be incrementally removed.\n- Acceptance criteria: If “zero any” means across TypeScript sources, we meet it except for the framework-mandated interface parameter. If it includes template `$any`, that requires a broader follow-up.\n- If PR #507 intersects with these files or rules, confirm whether to rebase or open a new PR. Recommend a new, focused PR to keep diffs minimal.\n\nWhy this route fits 30 minutes\n- Single-file code change plus one ESLint config override and small doc edits. No dependency updates or wide refactors.\n- Leaves templates untouched to minimize scope; policy clarifies future direction.\n\nValidation\n- Static search: ensure no remaining explicit `any` in TypeScript aside from `writeValue`.\n- Lint: `cd frontend && npm run lint` should pass with the override in place.\n- Build/tests: `cd frontend && npm run build && npm test -- --watch=false` (if node_modules present in CI).\n\n```json\n{\"steps\":[\"coder\",\"integrator\"],\"notes\":\"Replace the only TS-level any with a safe union in ui-select, allow the framework-required writeValue(any) via a file-scoped ESLint override, and document the no-explicit-any policy (unknown/generics, template $any guidance).
