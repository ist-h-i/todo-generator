        "preview": "**Release Summary**\n\n- Modernized select trigger and options panel across Angular app, keeping changes minimal and scoped.\n- Global native `<select>` triggers updated; shared Angular `UiSelectComponent` now renders a custom, modern dropdown panel.\n\n**What Changed**\n\n- Global styles: modern, centered chevron and spacing for selects.\n  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1`\n- Shared Angular select component: custom panel with rounded corners, shadow, max-height + scroll, hover/selected/active states, keyboard support; fixed `onTouched` visibility.\n  - `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:1`\n\n**Scope & Compatibility**\n\n- No new dependencies; Angular-only solution.\n- Usage of `<app-ui-select>` remains the same in Admin and Reports pages.\n- Native `<select>`s retain improved trigger visuals; their OS dropdown remains by design.\n- Single-selects use the custom panel; multi/size>1 continue using native control for minimal impact.\n\n**A11y & UX**\n\n- Trigger: simple down chevron, vertically centered; comfortable right padding.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"` and `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`; keyboard navigation (ArrowUp/Down, Enter, Esc).\n- Hidden native select in single mode is unfocusable and hidden from AT (`tabindex=\"-1\"`, `aria-hidden=\"true\"`, `inert`).\n\n**Risks**\n\n- Stacking context: confirm `z-index: 1000` clears headers/overlays in all layouts.\n- CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers might lack support (pre-existing risk).\n- RTL not explicitly handled (kept minimal to meet scope).\n\n**Verification Steps**\n\n- Build: from `frontend/`, run `npm ci && npm run build` (or `ng build --configuration production`).\n- Pages to check:\n  - Admin: `frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:1`\n  - Reports: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:1`\n- Validate:\n  - Trigger chevron is centered; spacing balanced; focus-visible outline appears.\n  - Panel opens under trigger with rounded corners, subtle border, shadow, smooth entry animation.\n  - States: hover highlight, selected checkmark, disabled item styling.\n  - Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down moves active item, Enter selects, Esc closes.\n  - Long lists: scroll within the panel; max-height respected.\n  - Light/dark theme parity; no clipping; no scroll bleed.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n\n- Revert the two touched files if needed:\n  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1`\n  - `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:1`\n- Temporary disable custom panel by switching affected instances to multi/size>1 (forces native select), if a hotfix is needed without code changes.\n\n**Notes on React/shadcn Request**\n\n- Repo is Angular + SCSS; introducing React/shadcn/Tailwind would be high-impact and out of scope for minimal change.\n- If a React/shadcn project is desired elsewhere, place components under `/components/ui` and install `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`. Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The dark-mode arrow now matches the text color via `currentColor`, fixing visibility while keeping the change minimal and centralized."

Only if the app is React/Next.\n\n**Success Criteria**\n- Hover state matches other inputs; no white-background mismatch.\n- Trigger icon is a single down chevron, vertically centered, not “stacked triangles”.\n- Icon uses currentColor so it matches text and is visible in dark mode.\n- Options panel looks modern (rounded, subtle border/shadow, clear item hover).\n- Accessibility intact: focus-visible, keyboard navigation, disabled states.\n- No TS/CI errors; no regressions in multi-select or `size > 1`.\n\n**Unknowns**\n- Actual framework in use for the target UI (Angular vs React).\n- Which selector implementations are present (native select, custom Angular component, Angular Material).\n- Exact design tokens to match (hover bg/border, radii, shadows).\n- Whether RTL or high-contrast/forced-colors support is required.\n\n**Clarifying Questions**\n- Is the UI stack Angular (current repo) or React/Next with shadcn as in the snippet?\n- Which selector(s) should be standardized: native `<select>`, a shared Angular `ui-select`, `mat-select`, or all?\n- Should selector hover match input hover exactly (no background change, only border/ring), or use a subtle tinted bg?\n- Provide the canonical tokens for text, background, border, radius, shadow for light/dark to ensure perfect match?\n- Do we need RTL and forced-colors support in this change?\n- If React is indeed the target, should we create `components/ui`, add `@/lib/utils` with `cn`, and install `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons` now?\n- Any screens/components that must be excluded from the new styles?"

We’ll implement a minimal, centralized SCSS fix.\n- Problem focus: On hover, the select background turns too light (perceived “white”), diverging from other inputs. Unify hover behavior to match inputs with minimal UI drift.\n- Scope control: Single-file SCSS changes, no TS/template edits, no deps, no React setup.\n\nWhat to change\n\n- Keep select hover background consistent with inputs:\n  - Light theme: Remove or reduce the hover background lightening so it no longer jumps to white-ish; keep subtle border/box-shadow refinement only.\n  - Dark theme: Do the same (avoid brightening the background on hover).\n- Preserve existing tokens:\n  - Radius, border, focus ring, transitions, and currentColor-driven caret remain unchanged.\n- No changes to Angular component logic or assets.\n\nWhere to change\n\n- Update the select hover rules in the central stylesheet:\n  - frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:118\n  - frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:177\n- Optional alignment (if needed for total parity): If inputs use no hover background change at all, set the select hover background-color equal to its base background or remove the hover-specific background-color line entirely; keep border-color/box-shadow adjustments for tactile feedback.\n\nWhy this is minimal and safe\n\n- Single-point change applied across `.app-select` and `select.form-control`.\n- No behavior or API changes; no component churning.\n- Matches existing design tokens and keeps dark mode parity.\n- Leaves the modern, simple chevron (currentColor) intact, protecting the earlier fixes for icon visibility.\n\nRisks and mitigations\n\n- Risk: Some screens might have local overrides. Mitigation: central change should dominate; if conflicts surface, adjust specificity minimally.\n- Risk: Perception of reduced hover affordance if background no longer brightens. Mitigation: keep subtle border/box-shadow change on hover for feedback.\n\nTest plan\n\n- Build: `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build` or `ng build --configuration production`.\n- Manual checks (light/dark):\n  - Hover no longer jumps to white; background remains aligned with inputs.\n  - Focus-visible ring shows correctly; disabled state unchanged.\n  - Icon remains visible and matches text color (currentColor).\n- Pages to spot-check:\n  - frontend/src/app/features/settings/page.html:249\n  - frontend/src/app/features/settings/page.html:428\n  - frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:565\n  - frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:730\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:274\n\nNote on shadcn/React path\n\n- Current repo is Angular. If you want the shadcn/Radix Select:\n  - Requires a React + Tailwind + shadcn setup, `components/ui` convention, `@/lib/utils` `cn` helper, and packages `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`.\n  - This would be a separate, larger change, not advisable under the “minimal impact” and 30-minute constraints.\n\n```json\n{\"steps\":[\"coder\"],\"notes\":\"Centralize the fix by adjusting select hover styles in frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss to stop the background from turning white.

The repo is Angular; introducing React components and `/components/ui` would add unused complexity and dependencies.\n\n**Risks**\n- Missed templates without `app-select` may look inconsistent (CSS still targets `select.form-control`, mitigating risk).\n- RTL locales anchor caret to right; not yet mirrored.\n- High-contrast/forced-colors modes may need a fallback to native indicator for visibility.\n\n**Verification Checklist**\n- Visual: All selects show centered caret, adequate right padding, consistent radius and focus ring.\n- Pages: Settings, Reports, Analyze, Board, Admin — scan visible selects for consistency.\n- States: Hover/focus rings, disabled opacity/cursor, error borders (if any).\n- Multi-selects: No chevrons; padding/layout stable.\n- Dark mode: Chevron visibility and contrast are acceptable.\n- Mobile: Touch targets ≥44px; no overflow or clipped icon.\n\n**Rollout Plan**\n- Ship as a minor UI refinement; no migrations, no config changes.\n- Communicate usage: ensure new/edited selects include `class=\"form-control app-select\"`.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n- If issues arise, revert template edits and/or temporarily disable the select-specific block in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85`.\n- No dependency removals required.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Do we need RTL support now? If yes, we will add `:dir(rtl)` overrides for caret position.\n- Any custom non-native select widgets that should also adopt this style?"

The build error TS2341 occurred because onTouched was private when referenced by (blur)=\"onTouched()\".\n\n**Selector Design Status**\n- Centralized CSS for a modern, vertically centered single down-arrow caret is in place:\n  - Styles: frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:78\n  - Uses inline SVG chevron, padded trigger, hover/focus/disabled, multi-select, and dark mode variants.\n\n**React/shadcn Select (Prep Instructions)**\n- This repo is Angular. If/when you add a React app (e.g., Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn):\n  - Components path (shadcn convention): components/ui\n  - Add files:\n    - components/ui/select.tsx (provided Select)\n    - components/ui/label.tsx (provided Label)\n  - Ensure utility: lib/utils.ts exports cn(...)\n  - Install deps: npm i @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-icons\n  - Tailwind/shadcn setup: initialize Tailwind, shadcn CLI, and ensure tokens like bg-background, border-input are configured.\n\n**Why components/ui**\n- shadcn CLI scaffolds and docs assume components/ui, keeping primitives standardized and discoverable. It simplifies future component additions and consistency.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Build Angular to confirm: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build\n- If you want, I can add a quick safeguard to use (blur)=\"onTouched?.()\" and scan for other private members referenced in templates.\n\n**Questions**\n- Should the React Select be integrated now (in a separate React app), or just prepped for future?\n- Any RTL or legacy browser constraints for the select visuals?\n- Any modules that should retain current selector styling and be excluded?"

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps.

Confirm team preference on location.\n- Coverage limits: Regex/lightweight parsing may miss multi-line signatures, getters/setters, or complex decorators; acceptable for initial stubs.\n- Depth: Currently documents public API; extend if private members are critical.\n- Adoption: Decide whether to run generator broadly now or seed per-feature gradually to keep diffs small.\n- Next small improvements (optional): support `export default class`, include `static` members, basic `@Input/@Output` capture, and a “Skipped existing” summary in script output."

Acceptable for initial pass.\n- Dual conventions (per-file vs per-class) are both present; README already positions Angular to use per-class, backend to use per-file—keep this distinction consistent in practice.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve as delivered.

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

If it includes template `$any(...)`, plan a small follow-up to type controls/events and remove a subset incrementally.\n- Scope control: Changes are minimal and localized; no unrelated refactors or upgrades.\n- PR flow: Confirm whether to update PR #507 or open a new, focused PR summarizing the verification and documentation alignment.\n- Residual risk: Numerous `$any(...)` casts in templates remain; safe removal requires per-template typing and should be addressed in small batches."

The prior TS2341 error is fixed by making `onTouched` public.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Trigger: vertically centered simple chevron; spacing balanced; `.ui-select__trigger` suppresses background-image from global select styles.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"`, items `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`, smooth animation, `z-index: 1000`, dark theme parity, high‑contrast safeguard for the chevron icon.\n- Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down navigation, Enter to select, Escape to close; click‑outside to dismiss.\n- Minimal impact: native `<select>` retained for multi/size; global `_base.scss` keeps parity for native selects.\n\n**Issues To Address (Small, High-Value)**\n- Hidden native select remains focusable in single mode.\n  - Impact: Tab order includes an invisible control; screen reader noise and confusing focus.\n  - Fix: On the hidden select (`.ui-select__native--hidden`) add `[attr.tabindex]=\\\"-1\\\" [attr.aria-hidden]=\\\"true\\\" inert`. This keeps it in DOM for option parsing/value sync while removing it from focus and accessibility trees.\n- Keyboard polish (optional but low‑effort):\n  - Scroll active option into view when opening or moving the active index (e.g., `element.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`).\n  - Support Home/End keys to jump to first/last option.\n  - Consider `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger and `id` on options to expose the active state to AT.\n- Focus styling for options (optional):\n  - Add `.ui-select__option:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }` for clearer keyboard focus.\n- Stacking context (verify):\n  - `z-index: 1000` is likely fine; confirm it clears any app toolbars/overlays.\n\n**Security/Perf/Compat**\n- No new dependencies. CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers may lack support (already present elsewhere).\n- DOM reads are minimal; event listeners are scoped. No obvious security risks.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve with one required fix: make the hidden select unfocusable/hidden to AT in single mode.\n- Optional niceties: scroll active item into view, Home/End keys, focus-visible outline, and `aria-activedescendant`. These are small and safe enhancements if you want me to add them.\n"

Safe replacement requires typing FormControls/event targets per template; propose incremental cleanup.\n- Acceptance criteria: If “zero any” includes template `$any`, a follow-up is needed; if limited to TS code, this meets the bar with the CVA exception.\n- Coordination with PR #507: Confirm whether to supersede or rebase; current tree already reflects the intended state.\n\n**How To Land Safely**\n\n- Open a short “confirm and document” PR or update PR #507 with a summary that no further code changes were needed and that docs and lint rules are in place.\n- Note the CVA exception and the future effort to reduce `$any(...)` in templates.\n\n**Validation Commands**\n\n- Scan for explicit any in TypeScript:\n  - rg -n \"\\bany\\b\" -S -t ts\n- Frontend lint/build/tests:\n  - cd frontend && npm run lint\n  - cd frontend && npm run build\n  - cd frontend && npm test -- --watch=false\n\nIf you want, I can scope a minimal follow-up to replace a small set of `$any(...)` casts in one feature template with typed controls."

The repo already contains the targeted changes outlined by earlier stages, so no additional code edits are necessary.\n\nFindings\n- TypeScript any usage:\n  - Code: Only `writeValue(obj: any)` in `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:205` (required by ControlValueAccessor).\n  - Templates: Multiple `$any(...)` casts across feature templates (scoped to `.html`).\n- Typing fix already present:\n  - `value` is typed as `string | string[] | null` and conversions are contained within the component.\n- Lint enforcement:\n  - `frontend/.eslintrc.cjs` enforces `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: error` with a file-scoped override only for `src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts` to permit `writeValue(any)`.\n- TS config:\n  - `frontend/tsconfig.json` has `strict: true` and strict Angular template checking enabled.\n- Documentation:\n  - `docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md` and `docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md` both document “no explicit any”, preference for unknown/generics, and the narrow ControlValueAccessor exception.\n\nNo Changes Required\n- Code and docs already align with the stated objectives. I did not apply any patch to avoid unnecessary churn.\n\nValidation Commands\n- Search for any in TS (excludes templates):\n  - rg -n \"\\bany\\b\" frontend/src --type-add 'ts:*.ts' -t ts -S | rg -v \"\\.html:\"\n- Lint/build/tests:\n  - cd frontend && npm run lint\n  - cd frontend && npm run build\n  - cd frontend && npm test -- --watch=false\n\nResidual Risks / Open Questions\n- Template `$any(...)` casts remain. Safe removal requires typing FormControls and event targets per template; recommend incremental cleanup.\n- Acceptance criteria: If “zero any” applies to TS code only, this meets it (with the framework-required exception). If it includes template `$any`, that needs a broader follow-up.\n- Confirm whether to base on or supersede PR #507; current tree appears consistent with the planned changes.\n\nIf you want, I can scope and remove a small batch of `$any(...)` casts in one feature template as a follow-up with minimal diff."

ESLint already has `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: \"error\"`.\n\nPlan\n- Tight code fix: Replace `value: any` with a safe union type; keep `writeValue(obj: any)` because Angular ControlValueAccessor requires it.\n- Enforce lint: Add a file-scoped ESLint override for `ui-select.ts` so `writeValue` doesn’t violate the rule.\n- Docs alignment: Update Angular guidelines to clarify “no explicit any” with `unknown` preference, generics, and template `$any` guidance. Update governance handbook with a narrow CVA exception.\n\nChanges made (targeted)\n- frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts: Typed `value` as `string | string[] | null` and cast in `writeValue` to avoid leaking any internally.\n- frontend/.eslintrc.cjs: Added file-level override to disable `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` only for `src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts` to permit `ControlValueAccessor.writeValue(obj: any)`.\n- docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md: Clarified no-explicit-any policy, use of `unknown` and generics, and discouraged `$any(...)` in templates except as a narrow, temporary bridge.\n- docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md: Noted the ControlValueAccessor `writeValue(obj: any)` exception and recommended handling via ESLint file override.\n\nRisks / Open Questions\n- Template `$any(...)` casts remain; replacing them safely would exceed the 30-minute window. They are called out in guidelines as discouraged and should be incrementally removed.\n- Acceptance criteria: If “zero any” means across TypeScript sources, we meet it except for the framework-mandated interface parameter. If it includes template `$any`, that requires a broader follow-up.\n- If PR #507 intersects with these files or rules, confirm whether to rebase or open a new PR. Recommend a new, focused PR to keep diffs minimal.\n\nWhy this route fits 30 minutes\n- Single-file code change plus one ESLint config override and small doc edits. No dependency updates or wide refactors.\n- Leaves templates untouched to minimize scope; policy clarifies future direction.\n\nValidation\n- Static search: ensure no remaining explicit `any` in TypeScript aside from `writeValue`.\n- Lint: `cd frontend && npm run lint` should pass with the override in place.\n- Build/tests: `cd frontend && npm run build && npm test -- --watch=false` (if node_modules present in CI).\n\n```json\n{\"steps\":[\"coder\",\"integrator\"],\"notes\":\"Replace the only TS-level any with a safe union in ui-select, allow the framework-required writeValue(any) via a file-scoped ESLint override, and document the no-explicit-any policy (unknown/generics, template $any guidance). Keep scope minimal; do not refactor templates. Residual risk: numerous template $any casts remain; flagged for incremental cleanup.\",\"tests\":\"- rg -n \\\"\\\\bany\\\\b\\\" frontend/src | rg -v \\\"\\\\.html:\\\" returns only writeValue signature.\\n- cd frontend && npm run lint (should pass due to override).\\n- cd frontend && npm run build && npm test -- --watch=false (sanity check in CI).\\n\"}```"
