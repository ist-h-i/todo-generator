Create it to keep shadcn-generated imports consistent.\n  - Install: `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`.\n  - Add `select.tsx` and `demo.tsx` under `/components/ui`, and `label.tsx` (from “originui/label”) under `/components/ui/label.tsx`.\n  - Ensure Tailwind and Typescript are set up; shadcn CLI scaffolds typical structure.\n- For this Angular repo, the equivalen"

Suggest hiding it in forced-colors and relying on native affordances.\n- RTL: rules use physical `right`; acceptable for now, but logical properties could be a follow-up if RTL is required.\n- If `color-mix()` is used anywhere for subtle tints, ensure acceptable browser support or add a conservative fallback.\n\n**Lightweight Suggestions (Optional)**\n- Add a11y safeguard:\n  - `@media (forced-colors: active) { .app-select, select.form-control { background-image: none; } }` in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:225` (or nearby global select rules).\n\n**Notes on React/shadcn Instructions**\n- This repo is Angular; introducing React/shadcn and Radix would violate minimal-change constraints. The centralized Angular/SCSS solution already satisfies the requirements.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve. The implementation is correct, minimal, and resolves the reported issues. Optional a11y tweak can be a small follow-up if desired."

No new dependencies or build changes.\n\n**Scope of Changes**\n- Standardized native selects to the modern style with vertically centered trigger icon.\n- CSS implements the design globally; one remaining template updated for consistent class usage.\n- Files:\n  - CSS: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85` — modern select styling, caret centered via `background-position: right … center`.\n  - Template: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255` — added `app-select` to select class.\n\n**Not in Scope (By Design)**\n- No React/shadcn/Radix integration. The repo is Angular; introducing React components and `/components/ui` would add unused complexity and dependencies.\n\n**Risks**\n- Missed templates without `app-select` may look inconsistent (CSS still targets `select.form-control`, mitigating risk).\n- RTL locales anchor caret to right; not yet mirrored.\n- High-contrast/forced-colors modes may need a fallback to native indicator for visibility.\n\n**Verification Checklist**\n- Visual: All selects show centered caret, adequate right padding, consistent radius and focus ring.\n- Pages: Settings, Reports, Analyze, Board, Admin — scan visible selects for consistency.\n- States: Hover/focus rings, disabled opacity/cursor, error borders (if any).\n- Multi-selects: No chevrons; padding/layout stable.\n- Dark mode: Chevron visibility and contrast are acceptable.\n- Mobile: Touch targets ≥44px; no overflow or clipped icon.\n\n**Rollout Plan**\n- Ship as a minor UI refinement; no migrations, no config changes.\n- Communicate usage: ensure new/edited selects include `class=\"form-control app-select\"`.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n- If issues arise, revert template edits and/or temporarily disable the select-specific block in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85`.\n- No dependency removals required.\n\n**Open Questions**\n- Do we need RTL support now? If yes, we will add `:dir(rtl)` overrides for caret position.\n- Any custom non-native select widgets that should also adopt this style?"

The build error TS2341 occurred because onTouched was private when referenced by (blur)=\"onTouched()\".\n\n**Selector Design Status**\n- Centralized CSS for a modern, vertically centered single down-arrow caret is in place:\n  - Styles: frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:78\n  - Uses inline SVG chevron, padded trigger, hover/focus/disabled, multi-select, and dark mode variants.\n\n**React/shadcn Select (Prep Instructions)**\n- This repo is Angular. If/when you add a React app (e.g., Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn):\n  - Components path (shadcn convention): components/ui\n  - Add files:\n    - components/ui/select.tsx (provided Select)\n    - components/ui/label.tsx (provided Label)\n  - Ensure utility: lib/utils.ts exports cn(...)\n  - Install deps: npm i @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-icons\n  - Tailwind/shadcn setup: initialize Tailwind, shadcn CLI, and ensure tokens like bg-background, border-input are configured.\n\n**Why components/ui**\n- shadcn CLI scaffolds and docs assume components/ui, keeping primitives standardized and discoverable. It simplifies future component additions and consistency.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Build Angular to confirm: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build\n- If you want, I can add a quick safeguard to use (blur)=\"onTouched?.()\" and scan for other private members referenced in templates.\n\n**Questions**\n- Should the React Select be integrated now (in a separate React app), or just prepped for future?\n- Any RTL or legacy browser constraints for the select visuals?\n- Any modules that should retain current selector styling and be excluded?"

Examples:\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/App.recipe.md`\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/core/profile/ProfileService.recipe.md`\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/features/board/BoardPage.recipe.md`\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/UiSelectComponent.recipe.md`\n\n**影響**\n- Docs-only change; no code, build, or runtime impact.\n- Enables consistent, per-class documentation with a mirrored docs path.\n- Safe to re-run the generator; no churn due to idempotency.\n\n**検証**\n- Generate recipes: `python scripts/generate_class_recipes.py`\n- Re-run to confirm idempotency (no new files on second run).\n- Sanity-check coverage:\n  - Count classes: `rg -n \"^\\s*export\\s+(default\\s+)?class\\s+\\w+\" frontend/src/app | wc -l`\n  - Count recipes: `find docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app -type f -name \"*.recipe.md\" | wc -l`\n- Spot-check created examples to confirm structure and public API listing:\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/core/logger/Logger.recipe.md`\n  - `docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app/features/reports/ReportAssistantPageComponent.recipe.md`\n\n**レビュー観点**\n- Convention alignment: Per-class under `docs/recipes/classes/` matches user preference; avoids cluttering source.\n- Coverage limits: Lightweight parsing may miss rare patterns (e.g., complex multiline class declarations, `export default class`, `static` members).\n- Clarity/completeness: Stubs include sections for Purpose, Public API (methods/properties), Dependencies, Usage Notes; owners can fill details incrementally.\n- Optional improvements (small/safe):\n  - Extend parsing to capture `static` members and `export default class`.\n  - Basic `@Input/@Output` awareness for Angular components.\n- Open questions:\n  - Language depth (English-only vs bilingual JP/EN).\n  - Whether to extend beyond Angular to other areas later."

Acceptable for initial pass.\n- Dual conventions (per-file vs per-class) are both present; README already positions Angular to use per-class, backend to use per-file—keep this distinction consistent in practice.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve as delivered. No required fixes. The optional improvements above are small, safe, and would increase coverage and ergonomics."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

If it includes template `$any(...)`, plan a small follow-up to type controls/events and remove a subset incrementally.\n- Scope control: Changes are minimal and localized; no unrelated refactors or upgrades.\n- PR flow: Confirm whether to update PR #507 or open a new, focused PR summarizing the verification and documentation alignment.\n- Residual risk: Numerous `$any(...)` casts in templates remain; safe removal requires per-template typing and should be addressed in small batches."

The prior TS2341 error is fixed by making `onTouched` public.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Trigger: vertically centered simple chevron; spacing balanced; `.ui-select__trigger` suppresses background-image from global select styles.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"`, items `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`, smooth animation, `z-index: 1000`, dark theme parity, high‑contrast safeguard for the chevron icon.\n- Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down navigation, Enter to select, Escape to close; click‑outside to dismiss.\n- Minimal impact: native `<select>` retained for multi/size; global `_base.scss` keeps parity for native selects.\n\n**Issues To Address (Small, High-Value)**\n- Hidden native select remains focusable in single mode.\n  - Impact: Tab order includes an invisible control; screen reader noise and confusing focus.\n  - Fix: On the hidden select (`.ui-select__native--hidden`) add `[attr.tabindex]=\\\"-1\\\" [attr.aria-hidden]=\\\"true\\\" inert`. This keeps it in DOM for option parsing/value sync while removing it from focus and accessibility trees.\n- Keyboard polish (optional but low‑effort):\n  - Scroll active option into view when opening or moving the active index (e.g., `element.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`).\n  - Support Home/End keys to jump to first/last option.\n  - Consider `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger and `id` on options to expose the active state to AT.\n- Focus styling for options (optional):\n  - Add `.ui-select__option:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }` for clearer keyboard focus.\n- Stacking context (verify):\n  - `z-index: 1000` is likely fine; confirm it clears any app toolbars/overlays.\n\n**Security/Perf/Compat**\n- No new dependencies. CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers may lack support (already present elsewhere).\n- DOM reads are minimal; event listeners are scoped. No obvious security risks.\n\n**Verdict**\n- Approve with one required fix: make the hidden select unfocusable/hidden to AT in single mode.\n- Optional niceties: scroll active item into view, Home/End keys, focus-visible outline, and `aria-activedescendant`. These are small and safe enhancements if you want me to add them.\n"

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps.

By normalizing to a string array first, includes is always safe, and the logic remains consistent for both single and multi-select.\n\nKey references\n- Selection check now uses a normalized array:\n  - frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:256\n- Multiple mode label derivation already safe:\n  - frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:286\n\nImpact\n- Behavior unchanged; only safer type handling.\n- Styles and the modernized arrow/currentColor alignment remain intact.\n- Scope is a single-file, minimal change.\n\nHow to verify\n- Build: cd frontend && ng build --configuration production\n- Tests: cd frontend && npm test (Karma should start with 0 load errors)\n- Manual: Confirm selects show correct labels for single/multi, and no console errors. Dark mode arrow remains visible and matches text color.\n\nNote on React/shadcn request\n- This repo is Angular. The provided React/shadcn component path (/components/ui) doesn’t apply here. We retained the Angular shared select (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts) and centralized SCSS updates for minimal impact and full app coverage. If you need a separate React setup, I can provide a shadcn/Tailwind guide and component placement under /components/ui in a React app."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The frontend removed the nickname/email overwrite logic and prefers nickname for defaults.

Good.\n- Read‑time resolution batches ids per response; avoids N+1. Good.\n- Update and create paths canonicalize both card assignees and subtask assignee. Good.\n- Filters: server‑side `assignees` query filters by stored values (now userIds). UI appears to filter client‑side; no current breakage spotted.\n\n**Gaps / Risks**\n- Status reports still emit raw stored assignee values (now userIds):\n  - backend/app/services/status_report_presenter.py:63–92, 112–128\n  - Impact: Status report cards may display userIds instead of nicknames.\n- Display fallback might be empty when both nickname and email are empty:\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:198–203 returns “” if email missing; consider falling back to userId for non‑empty display.\n- Filtering by assignees via `GET /cards?assignees=` expects userIds now. If any external caller sends emails/nicknames, results will differ. The SPA doesn’t use this param currently, but integrations might.\n- Migration ambiguity: duplicate nicknames are skipped by design; those records remain as legacy strings until updated. Acceptable, but consider logging count for observability.\n\n**Lightweight Fixes (recommended)**\n- Resolve assignee display names in status report serialization (mirrors cards router):\n  - In backend/app/services/status_report_presenter.py, batch map card.assignees and subtask.assignee via `object_session` to nickname/email.\n  - Sketch:\n    - Import: `from sqlalchemy.orm import object_session`\n    - Collect `user_ids` from linked cards/subtasks; query users; build map like `_resolve_display_names`.\n    - Replace assignees/subtasks in `serialize_card_link` similar to `_card_read_with_display`.\n- Improve fallback in display resolution:\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:198–203: if neither nickname nor email is present, fall back to `user.id`.\n\n**Performance**\n- Per‑request batching for id→name is used; good. If usage grows, consider request‑scoped caching to avoid repeat mapping across multiple endpoints in the same request (optional).\n\n**Tests/Verificat"

Dismissal animates by sliding out to the right.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n- Placement: bottom-right fixed container; vertical stack.\n- Order: newest above older within the stack (confirm for bottom-right).\n- Entry: animated appearance; prior spec said “drop from top,” which may conflict with bottom anchoring; slide-in from right is acceptable if preferred.\n- Exit: slide-out to the right on dismissal.\n- Durations/colors:\n  - Error: persistent, red.\n  - Warning: 10s, yellow.\n  - Notice: 5s, green.\n  - System/Loading: ≥3s; loading persists until completion, blue.\n- Queue: in-memory array; ID-based control for update/dismiss.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- Angular SPA; implement as a service + a single host component.\n- No new dependencies; CSS-only animations.\n- Use existing design tokens for colors/shadows.\n- Programmatic API supports show/update/dismiss, and loading returns an ID.\n\n**Constraints**\n- Minimal changes; avoid replacing broad UI unless necessary.\n- Deliver a complete, self-contained outcome without new packages.\n\n**Unknowns**\n- Exact color/shadow tokens for severities.\n- Max visible toasts and overflow behavior.\n- Whether sticky errors need a close button.\n- A11y requirements (roles, aria-live, keyboard dismissal).\n- Hover-to-pause timers behavior.\n- Deduplication of repeated messages.\n- Interaction with existing notification mechanisms.\n\n**Clarifying questions**\n- With bottom-right placement, should new messages appear at the bottom (closest to the edge, pushing older upward) or remain “newest on top” as originally specified?\n- Entry animation preference at bottom-right: keep “drop from top,” switch to “slide-in from right,” or a subtle fade/scale-in?\n- Do sticky errors require a visible close button, or are they programmatic-only?\n- Cap visible toasts (e.g., 4) and queue the rest?\n- Any specific a11y requirements (aria-live level, roles, focus handling, keyboard dismissal)?\n- Should timers pause on hover/focus?\n- Dedup policy for identical repeated messages?\n- Any mobile safe-area padding and z-index layering constraints?\n- Should we replace or integrate with any existing notification system?\n\n**Residual risks**\n- Visual mismatch if “drop from top” is retained at bottom-right; may look odd without confirmation.\n- Persistent errors can accumulate without a close affordance.\n- Overlap risks with other bottom-anchored UI (chat widgets, FABs, nav bars) without safe-area rules."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The dark-mode arrow now matches the text color via `currentColor`, fixing visibility while keeping the change minimal and centralized."

By explicitly setting the trigger’s color to `var(--text-primary)` in dark mode, both the text and the icon adopt the same visible, high-contrast color.\n- Native `<select>` arrows are already rendered via a CSS background SVG using `currentColor` and are covered by global styles:\n  - frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85\n  - frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:164\n\n**Scope and Risk**\n\n- Scope is minimal and targeted to the shared select trigger in dark mode.\n- No logic changes, no dependency changes, no React/shadcn added (repo is Angular).\n- Existing states (hover/focus/disabled) remain unchanged.\n\n**How to Verify**\n\n- In dark mode, check any screen using the custom select (e.g., Admin/Reports/Settings):\n  - The down-arrow inside the select trigger matches the text color and remains clearly visible.\n  - Hover/focus/disabled states look consistent.\n- For native selects (`.app-select`, `select.form-control`), confirm arrows are also visible; they inherit `currentColor` from:\n  - frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:164\n\n**Notes**\n\n- If any page intentionally changes the trigger text color, the arrow will follow (as requested: match text and icon colors)."

Switch to LR if preferred (flowchart LR).\n\n  %% Level 1 (A): Things to do / Can't do / Want to do\n  subgraph A[\"Level 1 – Actions & Constraints (Do / Can't / Want)\"]\n    %% Uncomment and edit actual items:\n    %% A1[\"Do: <text>\"]\n    %% A2[\"Can't: <text>\"]\n    %% A3[\"Want: <text>\"]\n  end\n\n  %% Level 2 (B, C)\n  subgraph B[\"Level 2 – Inhibitors\"]\n    %% B1[\"<inhibitor>\"]\n    %% B2[\"<inhibitor>\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph C[\"Level 2 – Shadow Goals / Ideals / Goals\"]\n    %% C1[\"<shadow goal / ideal>\"]\n    %% C2[\"<goal>\"]\n  end\n\n  %% Level 3 (D, E, F)\n  subgraph D[\"Level 3 – Deep Psychology / Bias (causing B)\"]\n    %% D1[\"<deep cause / bias>\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph E[\"Level 3 – True Needs (from B & C)\"]\n    %% E1[\"<true need>\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph F[\"Level 3 – Fundamental Fixed Concepts (from C)\"]\n    %% F1[\"<fixed concept>\"]\n  end\n\n  %% Edges (add only when both referenced nodes exist):\n  %% A1 --> B1\n  %% A1 --> C1\n  %% A2 --> B2\n  %% A3 --> C2\n  %% B1 --> D1\n  %% B1 --> E1\n  %% C1 --> E1\n  %% C1 --> F1\n```\n\nWhy this fits constraints\n- Single-file, documentation-only change; no code or build impact.\n- Renders in Mermaid Live Editor immediately.\n- Hides empty nodes/edges because nothing is uncommented by default.\n- Clear mapping of edges as required: A→B, A→C, B→D, B→E, C→E, C→F.\n\nOpen Questions\n- Keep letters A–F visible in subgraph titles? (Current template shows them in subgraph names only.)\n- Preferred direction: TD (current) vs LR.\n- Do you want a link added in docs/INDEX.md for discoverability? (Would add one more small change.)\n- Should we deprecate mentions of “Why-Why analysis” in docs/features/analytics-insights/requirements.md now, or in a later pass?\n\nRisks\n- Empty subgraphs still display their labeled headers; requirement focuses on nodes/edges, which this template hides by default. If full invisibility of empty groups is required, we’d need conditional generation (out of scope for Mermaid alone).\n- Existing references to 5 Whys remain; not changing them keeps scope minimal but may cause inconsistency until follow-up.\n\nValidation\n- Paste the snippet into Mermaid Live Editor; confirm it renders.\n- Uncomment a minimal pair like A1, B1, C1 and corresponding edges; confirm layout and connections render as expected.\n- Confirm that leaving any item commented omits its node/edge.\n\n```json\n{\"steps\":[\"coder\"],\"notes\":\"One-file documentation update: add docs/analysis/immune-map.md with a ready-to-render Mermaid Immunity Map template. No other files changed to minimize scope. Template uses commented example nodes/edges so only contentful items are shown, satisfying the hide-empty requirement.\",\"tests\":\"Manual: 1) Open Mermaid Live Editor and paste the snippet; verify it renders with empty groups only. 2) Uncomment A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1 progressively and add edges A1->B1, A1->C1, B1->D1, B1->E1, C1->E1, C1->F1; verify edges render correctly. 3) Re-comment nodes/edges to confirm they disappear without errors.\"}\n```"

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

The dark-mode arrow now matches the text color via `currentColor`, fixing visibility while keeping the change minimal and centralized."

If yes, who is authorized and how is it audited?\n- How should we migrate currently shared cards/boards where multiple users have access?\n- What is the expected default for new users (auto-create private channel name/visibility)?\n- Do we need a UI channel selector in card create/list now, or can we defer?\n- Are notifications or audit logs required for invite/leave/kick events?"

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps.

        "preview": "**Summary**\n- The fix correctly synchronizes programmatic values into the native select so projected <option> elements are reliably read and the label reflects the selected value.\n\n**Correctness**\n- `writeValue` mirrors the control value into the native select and then updates the label: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:240. This resolves the “no options/empty label” perception on init.\n- Options are built from projected `<option>` nodes and kept up to date via `MutationObserver`, with label sync after updates: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:216, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:220.\n- Selection logic is normalized for both single and multiple; label derives from current options and selected values: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:323.\n- Click, keyboard, and change paths maintain internal/native sync and propagate changes to the form control: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:266, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:293, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:362.\n\n**Readability**\n- The component maintains a clean separation of concerns: option reading, value/label sync, and UI event handling.\n- Public `onTouched` is clearly annotated for template usage; other callbacks are private and typed.\n- Template and styles are cohesive; comments succinctly document intent.\n\n**Edge Cases**\n- Multiple select: `writeValue` selects matching native options; label shows joined labels: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:247, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:331.\n- No options: active index defaults to 0; guarded usage prevents crashes, though -1 could be a cleaner sentinel (see suggestion).\n- Async option population: deferred initial read and observer-based updates handle late-projected options without console errors.\n\n**Usages Checked**\n- All current usages correctly project `<option>` children:\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:218\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:231\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:423\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:274\n- Placeholders are provided where needed; no refactor to a different API is required.\n\n**Risks / Open Questions**\n- Inert support on the hidden native select is broadly available, but older browsers may behave inconsistently. If issues arise, consider removing `inert` and rely on `aria-hidden` + styling.\n- No support for optgroups or custom templating beyond simple `<option disabled>`; confirm that’s acceptable for all current use cases.\n- For values not present in options (e.g., persisted “unknown” model), the label renders empty until the option appears. Current settings often inject an explicit `<option>` for the saved value (admin model picker), which is good.\n\n**Suggestions (Non-blocking)**\n- Consider setting `activeIndex` to -1 when `options.length === 0` for semantic clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:347.\n- Add `aria-labelledby` on the panel, pointing to the trigger, and optionally `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger when open for slightly improved a11y.\n- In `onDocClick`, rename `host` to `target` for clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:355.\n\nOverall, the implementation is correct, minimal, and aligns with existing usage patterns. No further call-site changes are needed."

Optionally enforce NOT NULL later.\n- No DB index on `cards.channel_id`; add if list queries grow.\n- Invitation uses email and auto‑joins; no approval/notifications yet.\n- No cross‑channel move policy (explicitly blocked).\n\n**Verification Steps**\n\n- Start backend: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --app-dir backend`\n- Channels\n  - `GET /channels/mine` returns private channel after register.\n  - `POST /channels/{id}/invite { email }` adds member; `leave` removes; `kick` owner‑only.\n- Cards\n  - `POST /cards` without `channel_id` → created with private channel; response has `channel_id`.\n  - `POST /cards` with non‑member `channel_id` → 403.\n  - `GET /cards` only returns member‑channel cards.\n  - `PUT /cards/{id}` with `channel_id` → 409.\n- Subtasks\n  - As non‑owner member, `PUT`/`DELETE` subtask on a member‑channel card succeeds.\n"

Tests cover re-encryption and error cases.\n  - backend/app/utils/secrets.py masking logic protects short secrets; tests confirm.\n\nTiny Nits / Edge Cases\n- The middleware’s OPTIONS branch delegates to downstream middleware; it’s fine given the earlier preflight middleware, but could return early for symmetry. No change needed.\n- Referrer-Policy: no-referrer is strict. If any flow relies on referrers, consider strict-origin-when-cross-origin in a later pass.\n\nApplied Fixes\n- docs/security-review.md\n  - Replaced outdated “Weak secret storage cipher” with “Secret storage (Hardened)” describing Fernet + legacy rotation path.\n  - Updated “Secret hint” section to reflect current, safe masking behavior.\n  - Scope-limited doc edits only; no runtime impact.\n\nResidual Risks\n- HSTS requires HTTPS in production to be effective.\n- COOP/CORP are safe for APIs; keep an eye on any cross-origin embedding needs.\n- SPA tokens remain in localStorage; migration to secure, httpOnly cookies is still recommended in a future coordinated cycle.\n\nValidation\n- Suggest running: pytest -q backend/tests/test_security_headers.py::test_api_sets_security_headers_on_healthcheck\n- Full suite: pytest -q backend/tests (tests appear self-contained and should not require network)."

Keyboard and ARIA behavior remain intact.\n\nWhy this fixes “Level” options\n- The admin “レベル” field uses projected static options: frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129–132\n- With deferred read + MutationObserver, the component now consistently discovers those options even when rendering timing varies, so the dropdown shows items and selection persists.\n\nKey file references\n- Shared select: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:205, 219, 233\n- Admin “レベル”: frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129–132\n- Default value (junior): frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.ts:81, 242\n\nManual verification\n- Admin → コンピテンシー登録:\n  - Open “レベル” dropdown; see “初級 (3段階)” and “中級 (5段階)”.\n  - Select both values; submit; payload includes selected level.\n- Spot-check other selects (reports/status, priority, and admin evaluation selects) for populated options and selection.\n- Optional commands (if deps are installed):\n  - cd frontend && npm run lint\n  - cd frontend && npm start\n\nResidual risks / open questions\n- If options are API-driven and return empty, UI will still show none (backend issue).\n- If labels depend on i18n and keys are missing, labels could be blank despite this fix.\n- In SSR/hydration contexts, MutationObserver should only run in the browser; current SPA views are client-only, but SSR views should be sanity-checked."

Tests cover re-encryption and error cases.\n  - backend/app/utils/secrets.py masking logic protects short secrets; tests confirm.\n\nTiny Nits / Edge Cases\n- The middleware’s OPTIONS branch delegates to downstream middleware; it’s fine given the earlier preflight middleware, but could return early for symmetry. No change needed.\n- Referrer-Policy: no-referrer is strict. If any flow relies on referrers, consider strict-origin-when-cross-origin in a later pass.\n\nApplied Fixes\n- docs/security-review.md\n  - Replaced outdated “Weak secret storage cipher” with “Secret storage (Hardened)” describing Fernet + legacy rotation path.\n  - Updated “Secret hint” section to reflect current, safe masking behavior.\n  - Scope-limited doc edits only; no runtime impact.\n\nResidual Risks\n- HSTS requires HTTPS in production to be effective.\n- COOP/CORP are safe for APIs; keep an eye on any cross-origin embedding needs.\n- SPA tokens remain in localStorage; migration to secure, httpOnly cookies is still recommended in a future coordinated cycle.\n\nValidation\n- Suggest running: pytest -q backend/tests/test_security_headers.py::test_api_sets_security_headers_on_healthcheck\n- Full suite: pytest -q backend/tests (tests appear self-contained and should not require network)."

        "preview": "**Release Summary**\n\n- Modernized select trigger and options panel across Angular app, keeping changes minimal and scoped.\n- Global native `<select>` triggers updated; shared Angular `UiSelectComponent` now renders a custom, modern dropdown panel.\n\n**What Changed**\n\n- Global styles: modern, centered chevron and spacing for selects.\n  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1`\n- Shared Angular select component: custom panel with rounded corners, shadow, max-height + scroll, hover/selected/active states, keyboard support; fixed `onTouched` visibility.\n  - `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:1`\n\n**Scope & Compatibility**\n\n- No new dependencies; Angular-only solution.\n- Usage of `<app-ui-select>` remains the same in Admin and Reports pages.\n- Native `<select>`s retain improved trigger visuals; their OS dropdown remains by design.\n- Single-selects use the custom panel; multi/size>1 continue using native control for minimal impact.\n\n**A11y & UX**\n\n- Trigger: simple down chevron, vertically centered; comfortable right padding.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"` and `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`; keyboard navigation (ArrowUp/Down, Enter, Esc).\n- Hidden native select in single mode is unfocusable and hidden from AT (`tabindex=\"-1\"`, `aria-hidden=\"true\"`, `inert`).\n\n**Risks**\n\n- Stacking context: confirm `z-index: 1000` clears headers/overlays in all layouts.\n- CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers might lack support (pre-existing risk).\n- RTL not explicitly handled (kept minimal to meet scope).\n\n**Verification Steps**\n\n- Build: from `frontend/`, run `npm ci && npm run build` (or `ng build --configuration production`).\n- Pages to check:\n  - Admin: `frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:1`\n  - Reports: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:1`\n- Validate:\n  - Trigger chevron is centered; spacing balanced; focus-visible outline appears.\n  - Panel opens under trigger with rounded corners, subtle border, shadow, smooth entry animation.\n  - States: hover highlight, selected checkmark, disabled item styling.\n  - Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down moves active item, Enter selects, Esc closes.\n  - Long lists: scroll within the panel; max-height respected.\n  - Light/dark theme parity; no clipping; no scroll bleed.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n\n- Revert the two touched files if needed:\n  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1`\n  - `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:1`\n- Temporary disable custom panel by switching affected instances to multi/size>1 (forces native select), if a hotfix is needed without code changes.\n\n**Notes on React/shadcn Request**\n\n- Repo is Angular + SCSS; introducing React/shadcn/Tailwind would be high-impact and out of scope for minimal change.\n- If a React/shadcn project is desired elsewhere, place components under `/components/ui` and install `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`. Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

Current work does not change sorting semantics.\n- Edge cases: Nickname identical to email will display that same value; confirm if alternate formatting is desired.\n- Data limits: Comments from API include `author_nickname` but not `author_email`; older comments cannot fall back to email unless backend adds it.\n\n残課題・リスク（明示）\n- Bypass risk if future components read `user.nickname` directly instead of `getDisplayName`.\n- Comments fallback limited by API fields; email-based fallback not possible for historical comments.\n- Potential ambiguity where email is expected for disambiguation in support/admin contexts; verify UX expectations per screen."

No additional code changes are required to meet the acceptance criteria with minimal impact.\n\nWhat’s in place\n- Shared helper for display name:\n  - frontend/src/app/shared/utils/display-name.ts:1\n  - Provides `getDisplayName({ nickname, email })` that trims values, prefers `nickname`, falls back to `email`.\n\n- Shell header shows nickname first:\n  - frontend/src/app/core/layout/shell/shell.ts:118 defines `displayName(user)` that delegates to `getDisplayName`.\n  - frontend/src/app/core/layout/shell/shell.html:225 uses `{{ displayName(currentUser) }}` for the visible “name”. Email is still shown in metadata line, which is acceptable for contexts explicitly showing email.\n\n- Workspace state and comments:\n  - frontend/src/app/core/state/workspace-store.ts:742 computes `activeUserNickname` with `getDisplayName` to keep default-assignee and current-user naming in sync.\n  - frontend/src/app/core/state/workspace-store.ts:749 `commentAuthorName` uses `getDisplayName(this.auth.user())`, falling back to ‘匿名ユーザー’ if not authenticated.\n  - Comment lists display `comment.authorNickname` (from API); when creating comments locally, the prefill follows the same nickname-first rule via `commentAuthorName`.\n\n- Admin/auth remain email-centric:\n  - Admin user selection and user list present emails (e.g., frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:295, 321), aligned with “do not change explicitly email contexts.”\n  - Auth pages use email fields only.\n\nNo changes needed\n- The scoped helper exists and is used in the shell header and workspace store as planned.\n- Behavior matches acceptance criteria, including whitespace-trim fallback and consistent use for current user display and comment author prefill.\n\nResidual risks / open questions\n- Comments from the API only include `author_nickname`/`author_id` (no `author_email`), so existing comments can’t fall back to email unless the backend adds it.\n- Sorting/search policies by “name” are not adjusted; lists might still sort on email strings where present.\n- Admin tables intentionally show email; confirm if there are any admin views that should display nickname alongside email.\n- Edge case where a user’s nickname equals their email will display that value unchanged; confirm if alternate formatting is desired.\n\nCommands to run\n- None required.

Tests cover re-encryption and error cases.\n  - backend/app/utils/secrets.py masking logic protects short secrets; tests confirm.\n\nTiny Nits / Edge Cases\n- The middleware’s OPTIONS branch delegates to downstream middleware; it’s fine given the earlier preflight middleware, but could return early for symmetry. No change needed.\n- Referrer-Policy: no-referrer is strict. If any flow relies on referrers, consider strict-origin-when-cross-origin in a later pass.\n\nApplied Fixes\n- docs/security-review.md\n  - Replaced outdated “Weak secret storage cipher” with “Secret storage (Hardened)” describing Fernet + legacy rotation path.\n  - Updated “Secret hint” section to reflect current, safe masking behavior.\n  - Scope-limited doc edits only; no runtime impact.\n\nResidual Risks\n- HSTS requires HTTPS in production to be effective.\n- COOP/CORP are safe for APIs; keep an eye on any cross-origin embedding needs.\n- SPA tokens remain in localStorage; migration to secure, httpOnly cookies is still recommended in a future coordinated cycle.\n\nValidation\n- Suggest running: pytest -q backend/tests/test_security_headers.py::test_api_sets_security_headers_on_healthcheck\n- Full suite: pytest -q backend/tests (tests appear self-contained and should not require network)."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

        "preview": "**Release Summary**\n\n- Modernized select trigger and options panel across Angular app, keeping changes minimal and scoped.\n- Global native `<select>` triggers updated; shared Angular `UiSelectComponent` now renders a custom, modern dropdown panel.\n\n**What Changed**\n\n- Global styles: modern, centered chevron and spacing for selects.\n  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1`\n- Shared Angular select component: custom panel with rounded corners, shadow, max-height + scroll, hover/selected/active states, keyboard support; fixed `onTouched` visibility.\n  - `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:1`\n\n**Scope & Compatibility**\n\n- No new dependencies; Angular-only solution.\n- Usage of `<app-ui-select>` remains the same in Admin and Reports pages.\n- Native `<select>`s retain improved trigger visuals; their OS dropdown remains by design.\n- Single-selects use the custom panel; multi/size>1 continue using native control for minimal impact.\n\n**A11y & UX**\n\n- Trigger: simple down chevron, vertically centered; comfortable right padding.\n- Panel: `role=\"listbox\"` and `role=\"option\"` with `aria-selected`; keyboard navigation (ArrowUp/Down, Enter, Esc).\n- Hidden native select in single mode is unfocusable and hidden from AT (`tabindex=\"-1\"`, `aria-hidden=\"true\"`, `inert`).\n\n**Risks**\n\n- Stacking context: confirm `z-index: 1000` clears headers/overlays in all layouts.\n- CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers might lack support (pre-existing risk).\n- RTL not explicitly handled (kept minimal to meet scope).\n\n**Verification Steps**\n\n- Build: from `frontend/`, run `npm ci && npm run build` (or `ng build --configuration production`).\n- Pages to check:\n  - Admin: `frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:1`\n  - Reports: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:1`\n- Validate:\n  - Trigger chevron is centered; spacing balanced; focus-visible outline appears.\n  - Panel opens under trigger with rounded corners, subtle border, shadow, smooth entry animation.\n  - States: hover highlight, selected checkmark, disabled item styling.\n  - Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down moves active item, Enter selects, Esc closes.\n  - Long lists: scroll within the panel; max-height respected.\n  - Light/dark theme parity; no clipping; no scroll bleed.\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n\n- Revert the two touched files if needed:\n  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:1`\n  - `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:1`\n- Temporary disable custom panel by switching affected instances to multi/size>1 (forces native select), if a hotfix is needed without code changes.\n\n**Notes on React/shadcn Request**\n\n- Repo is Angular + SCSS; introducing React/shadcn/Tailwind would be high-impact and out of scope for minimal change.\n- If a React/shadcn project is desired elsewhere, place components under `/components/ui` and install `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`. Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

Optional index for future uniqueness.\n- API: Accept `nickname` in registration DTO, validate server-side (2–32), trim, persist, include in response.\n- UI: Add required input to registration form; client validation mirrors server; include in payload; add i18n labels/help/error.\n- Tests: \n  - API: missing/too short/too long nickname rejected; valid saved and returned.\n  - UI: form blocks submit without valid nickname.\n  - Migration: verifies existing users are backfilled and column is NOT NULL.\n\n**Timeline Fit (≤30 min)**\n- Migration + backfill: 8–10 min\n- API DTO + handler validation: 8–10 min\n- UI form + i18n: 6–8 min\n- Tests (lightweight): 6–8 min\n- Buffer overlaps by pairing simple changes; cut optional index if time runs tight.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n- Uniqueness not enforced; duplicates possible until a later pass.\n- Validation rules may need tightening (character set, emoji, profanity).\n- SSO/social flows not adjusted; may register without nickname unless they hit the same endpoint—confirm flow parity.\n- Visibility/usage of nickname elsewhere is unchanged; clarify future display semantics.\n- If an existing `displayName` exists, reuse might be preferable—needs confirmation.\n- API versioning: extending payload may break older clients if they don’t supply nickname; acceptable given requirement?\n\n```json\n{\"steps\":[\"coder\",\"code_quality_reviewer\"],\"notes\":\"Leanest path: a single coder can implement migration, API, UI, and tests within 30 minutes.

        "preview": "**Summary**\nOverall implementation is close and follows existing patterns. I found and fixed three concrete issues that would have caused runtime errors or test failures:\n- Length mismatch between DB column and UI/server validation for nickname.\n- Two backend tests still registering without nickname.\n- Frontend test double for `AuthService.register` not matching the updated method signature.\n\nWhat I verified:\n- Backend accepts and persists `nickname` on register and returns it in the profile.\n- Startup migration backfills existing users’ nicknames and runs at app boot.\n- Frontend registration form includes a “ニックネーム” field, validates client-side, and sends the value.\n- Profile update flow also uses the same nickname validation style.\n\n**Fixes Applied**\n- Align nickname max length to DB column (64 chars) to avoid DB errors.\n  - backend/app/services/profile.py:1 – set max to 64\n  - frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.ts:220 – client nickname validation max 64\n  - frontend/src/app/core/profile/profile-dialog.ts:360 – profile dialog max 64\n\n- Update missed tests to include nickname on registration:\n  - backend/tests/test_admin_users.py:128, 171 – add `nickname: \"Second\"`\n\n- Fix frontend test double to match new register signature:\n  - frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.spec.ts:39 – add `nickname` to `RegisterCall`\n  - frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.spec.ts:57 – mock `register(email, password, nickname)`\n\n**Correctness & Edge Cases**\n- Registration\n  - API: `POST /auth/register` expects `{ email, password, nickname }`; missing/empty nickname returns 422 via `normalize_nickname`.\n  - Duplicate email yields 400; other validations unchanged.\n- Persistence\n  - DB column is `VARCHAR(64)` nullable; migration backfills NULL/empty with `user-{id}` ensuring non-empty values post-migration while keeping schema lenient.\n- Client/Server Validation\n  - Both sides enforce non-empty + max length 64; trimming is consistent.\n- Profile Update\n  - Uses the same max length (64) and error messaging; consistent with DB.\n\n**Readability & Consistency**\n- Reused existing error message patterns (Japanese messages) and validators. The nickname validation logic is concise and co-located with other profile validations.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n- Uniqueness: Not enforced; duplicates remain possible.\n- DB NOT NULL: Column remains nullable by schema (mitigated by backfill and required registration). If a hard guarantee is desired, consider a follow-up migration to set NOT NULL once backfill is broadly deployed.\n- Validation scope: No profanity/character-set rules; acceptable per current scope but may need refinement later.\n- SSO/social login: Not evaluated; ensure those flows also supply or prompt for nickname if they hit the same endpoint.\n- i18n/accessibility: Registration label does not visually mark “必須”; errors do communicate requirement.\n\n**File References (key changes)**\n- backend/app/services/profile.py:1\n- backend/app/routers/auth.py:1\n- backend/app/migrations.py:121, 164, 960\n- frontend/src/app/core/auth/auth.service.ts:69\n- frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.ts:1\n- frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.html:127\n- frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.spec.ts:39\n- frontend/src/app/core/profile/profile-dialog.ts:360\n- backend/tests/test_admin_users.py:128, 171\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n- Add a small server-side min length (e.g., 2) to reduce accidental single-character nicknames.\n- Propose a phased plan to enforce DB NOT NULL on `users.nickname` once backfill is safely rolled out."

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Not applied here.\n\n**Release Verdict**\n\n- Ready to ship. Changes are minimal, self-contained, and meet the “modern trigger + modern options panel” requirement, with no new deps. Recommended to complete the verification checklist above prior to tagging."

Ensure persistence, validation, and data model support; address existing users without nicknames.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- “Nickname” is a new user-profile attribute persisted server-side.\n- The field is required for new registrations.\n- Minimal UI/API changes beyond registration are preferred.\n- No immediate change to how names are displayed elsewhere unless specified.\n\n**Constraints**\n- Minimize impact and avoid unrelated refactors.\n- Deliver a self-contained, finished outcome (UI, API, data, tests).\n- Align with existing validation and i18n patterns.\n- Backward compatibility must be considered for existing APIs/clients.\n\n**Unknowns**\n- Uniqueness: Must nicknames be globally unique?\n- Validation: Allowed characters, length min/max, profanity/emoji handling.\n- Editability: Can users change nickname after signup? Frequency/rules?\n- Visibility: Publicly displayed vs internal-only.\n- Data model: Existing field (e.g., displayName/handle) vs new column?\n- Migration: Strategy for existing users lacking a nickname.\n- i18n: Final label/placeholder copy and supported locales.\n- External auth: Behavior for SSO/social login flows.\n- API contract: Field name (`nickname` vs `displayName`), request/response shape, versioning.\n\n## Clarifying questions\n- Should nicknames be unique across all users? If yes, is comparison case-insensitive and Unicode-normalized?\n- What are the validation rules (min/max length, allowed characters, profanity checks, emoji support)?\n- Can users change their nickname later? If so, are there rate limits or audit requirements?\n- Is the nickname intended to be publicly visible and used in UI, or internal only for now?\n- Do we already have a similar field (e.g., `displayName`) that should be reused instead of adding `nickname`?\n- How should we handle existing users without a nickname (migration default, prompt on next login, forced modal, or admin backfill)?\n- For SSO providers, should we prefill from provider attributes (e.g., `nickname`, `name`) and still require confirmation?\n- What is the exact API field name and where should it appear in requests/responses? Any API versioning concerns?\n- Are there accessibility or localization requirements for the new input’s label, help text, and validation messages?\n\n**Residual Risks**\n- Enforcing uniqueness or strong validation may block registrations without clear UX.\n- Divergence between client/server validation could cause inconsistent errors.\n- Migration for existing users may require user prompts and can disrupt flows.\n- Confusion if an existing “username/display name” concept already exists and overlaps with “nickname.”"

Store userIds going forward; leave unmatched values as-is to preserve data.\n  - Cards/Subtasks read path: Before returning responses for list/get/create/update, resolve display labels by mapping stored userIds to nicknames (fallback to email, then raw value). Return the label strings (nickname) in the existing `assignees`/`assignee` fields so the SPA keeps working without contract changes.\n  - Status reports: In the presenter, resolve `card.assignees` to nickname labels when serializing report card summaries (if feasible in 30 minutes); otherwise call out as follow-up risk.\n  - Migration: Add a startup migration step that scans `cards.assignees` and `subtasks.assignee` and replaces emails/nicknames with userIds when a unique match is found. Skip on ambiguity.\n- Frontend (Angular)\n  - Remove/disable the WorkspaceStore effect that overwrites assignee labels between nickname and email. If keeping defaulting, prefer nickname-only (no email fallback) to avoid regressions when nickname is missing.\n\nWhy this fits the 30-minute cap\n- No API surface changes; all transformations happen server-side within existing endpoints.\n- Thin, localized edits: cards router (create/update/list/get), subtasks endpoints, one presenter method, one Angular store effect.\n- Backfill is optional-safe and batched; skips on ambiguity.\n\nOpen questions\n- Exact fallback for unresolved userId at read-time: show raw value or a placeholder (“Unassigned”)? Proposal: show raw value to avoid data loss; “Unassigned” only when field empty.\n- Multiple assignees usage in UI: SPA currently displays a single `assignee`; we’ll continue using the first resolved nickname from the backend’s list.\n- Reports: If presenter cannot easily resolve nicknames without a session, short-term they may show raw ids. OK to defer?\n- Do we need to support searching/filtering by assignee nickname vs userId in `GET /cards`? Currently filters use strings; with server-side resolution to nickname for display only, the filter semantics may need review.\n\nResidual risks\n- Legacy records with emails/nicknames that do not match a user won’t be normalized; those will display as-is.\n- Performance: resolving nicknames could add DB lookups; mitigate by batching per response and caching within request scope.\n- Reports may still show ids if not updated; small UX inconsistency until addressed.\n- Any external integrations expecting email in `assignees` may be impacted; we’re returning nicknames for display.\n\nAcceptance alignment\n- Persist links via userId; display nickname resolved from userId.\n- Remove front-end logic that overwrites nickname/email labels.\n- Provide a safe, best-effort migration from legacy strings to userIds.\n- Maintain backward compatibility by keeping response fields stable and providing graceful fallbacks.\n\nProposed tasks (coder)\n- Backend\n  - Add helper: canonicalize-assignees (email/nickname/id → id) with DB lookups; batch resolvers for id→display-name.\n  - Cards router: apply canonicalization on create/update; resolve display names on list/get before returning.\n  - Subtasks router: apply canonicalization on create/update; resolve display names on list/get.\n  - Status report presenter: resolve `assignees` to nicknames if feasible.\n  - Migration: add `_normalize_assignees_to_user_ids(engine)` in `migrations.py` and call from `run_startup_migrations`.\n- Frontend\n  - Remove `syncDef"

The same fields exist; only values now display nicknames resolved from userIds.\n- Storage format for labels, statuses, etc. unchanged.\n\nVerification steps\n- Backend\n  - Create a user U (email X, nickname N).\n  - POST /cards with assignees [\"X\"].\n    - DB stores [\"U.id\"]; response shows assignees [\"N\"].\n  - PUT /cards/{id} with assignees [\"N\"].\n    - DB stores [\"U.id\"]; response shows [\"N\"].\n  - POST /cards/{id}/subtasks with assignee \"X\".\n    - DB stores \"U.id\"; response shows \"N\".\n  - GET /cards and GET /cards/{id} both show nickname labels; no flicker in the SPA.\n\n- Migration\n  - With legacy data: cards.assignees like [\"someone@example.com\", \"unknown\"], subtasks.assignee \"Tester\".\n  - On startup, matching emails/nicknames convert to userIds; unmatched remain as-is.\n\nSuggested commands (run locally)\n- Backend tests: \n  - python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate\n  - pip install -r requirements.txt\n  - uvicorn backend.app.main:app or pytest -q (if tests are configured)\n- Frontend sanity:\n  - No API contract changes; just rebuild the SPA normally.\n\nOpen questions\n- Filtering by assignee: current GET /cards?assignees= compares against stored values (now userIds). If the UI sends nicknames in filters, we should normalize inputs server-side; confirm expected client behavior.\n- Status reports: StatusReportPresenter currently forwards card.assignees as stored values; these will be userIds post-change. If needed, we can add the same display-name resolution there.\n\nResidual risks\n- Ambiguous nicknames during migration (same nickname across users) are skipped to avoid incorrect mapping; those entries remain as legacy strings.\n- Slight overhead per request to resolve userIds → nicknames; mitigated via per-request batching.

A best‑effort migration normalizes legacy assignee strings to userIds at startup.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Write‑time canonicalization: email/nickname/id → userId\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:105–156, 173–178 (_canonicalize_assignees/_canonicalize_single_assignee)\n- Read‑time display: userId → nickname (fallback email)\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:180–203 (_resolve_display_names)\n  - Applied consistently in list/get/create/update cards and in subtask list/create/update:\n    - list_cards: backend/app/routers/cards.py:492–520\n    - create_card: backend/app/routers/cards.py:604–680\n    - get_card: backend/app/routers/cards.py:689–699\n    - update_card: backend/app/routers/cards.py:720–758\n    - list_subtasks: backend/app/routers/cards.py:787–805\n    - create_subtask: backend/app/routers/cards.py:829–842\n    - update_subtask: backend/app/routers/cards.py:858–896\n- Data model remains minimally invasive (strings remain, values now userIds):\n  - backend/app/models.py:50–104 (Card.assignees JSON of strings)\n  - backend/app/models.py:214–242 (Subtask.assignee string)\n- Startup migration backfills legacy strings to userIds, preserving unmatched values:\n  - backend/app/migrations.py:1000–1080 (_normalize_assignees_to_user_ids)\n  - Invoked in run_startup_migrations: backend/app/migrations.py:1119–1140\n- SPA stops label flipping and prefers nickname for default assignee:\n  - frontend/src/app/core/state/workspace-store.ts:742–758, 780–816\n- API shapes unchanged; Cards API and board rendering remain compatible:\n  - frontend/src/app/core/api/cards-api.service.ts:139–171 (assignees typed as strings for display)\n\n**Correctness & Edge Cases**\n- Unique nickname handling during canonicalization and migration avoids ambiguity by skipping duplicates. Good.\n- Read‑time resolution batches ids per response; avoids N+1. Good.\n- Update and create paths canonicalize both card assignees and subtask assignee. Good.\n- Filters: server‑side `assignees` query filters by stored values (now userIds). UI appears to filter client‑side; no current breakage spotted.\n\n**Gaps / Risks**\n- Status reports still emit raw stored assignee values (now userIds):\n  - backend/app/services/status_report_presenter.py:63–92, 112–128\n  - Impact: Status report cards may display userIds instead of nicknames.\n- Display fallback might be empty when both nickname and email are empty:\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:198–203 returns “” if email missing; consider falling back to userId for non‑empty display.\n- Filtering by assignees via `GET /cards?assignees=` expects userIds now. If any external caller sends emails/nicknames, results will differ. The SPA doesn’t use this param currently, but integrations might.\n- Migration ambiguity: duplicate nicknames are skipped by design; those records remain as legacy strings until updated. Acceptable, but consider logging count for observability.\n\n**Lightweight Fixes (recommended)**\n- Resolve assignee display names in status report serialization (mirrors cards router):\n  - In backend/app/services/status_report_presenter.py, batch map card.assignees and subtask.assignee via `object_session` to nickname/email.\n  - Sketch:\n    - Import: `from sqlalchemy.orm import object_session`\n    - Collect `user_ids` from linked cards/subtasks; query users; build map like `_resolve_display_names`.\n    - Replace assignees/subtasks in `serialize_card_link` similar to `_card_read_with_display`.\n- Improve fallback in display resolution:\n  - backend/app/routers/cards.py:198–203: if neither nickname nor email is present, fall back to `user.id`.\n\n**Performance**\n- Per‑request batching for id→name is used; good. If usage grows, consider request‑scoped caching to avoid repeat mapping across multiple endpoints in the same request (optional).\n\n**Tests/Verificat"

Add selector later using `GET /channels/mine`.\n\n**Follow-ups (minimal)**\n- Add DB index for `cards.channel_id` when performance requires.\n- Define and implement channel transfer policy (owner-only? audit?) and enable controlled channel updates.\n- Add basic frontend dropdown for `Channel` in card creation with default selection; hide if only one channel."

Display the user’s nickname by resolving from `userId`. Remove logic that overwrites labels from nickname to email.\n\n**Goals**\n- Persist user linkage via `userId` instead of email/nickname strings.\n- Show assignee labels using the resolved user nickname.\n- Eliminate post-processing that overwrites labels with email.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- There is a canonical Users source exposing `userId`, `email`, and `nickname`.\n- `userId` is stable/unique and suitable as a foreign key.\n- Existing objects (e.g., Card, Task) currently store assignee as a string (email or nickname).\n- The SPA (Angular) renders assignee labels from object fields presently.\n- Backend and/or state management can resolve a user by `userId`.\n- Nicknames may change over time; resolving at read-time is acceptable.\n\n**Constraints**\n- Minimize scope and avoid unrelated refactors.\n- Deliver a complete, self-contained change (models, persistence, API/contracts, UI).\n- Maintain backward compatibility or provide a safe one-time migration for existing data.\n- Follow repo governance and Angular guidelines when touching SPA code.\n\n**Unknowns**\n- Exact entities/fields storing user info as strings (e.g., `Card.assignee`, `Task.owner`).\n- Source of truth for Users (DB table, API endpoint, cache).\n- Type/format of `userId` (UUID, numeric, string).\n- Whether multiple assignees are supported anywhere.\n- Current API contracts: do they already include `userId`?\n- Required handling when `userId` cannot be resolved to a user (deleted/disabled users).\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- All relevant objects use `userId` for user linkage.\n- UI shows nickname resolved from `userId`.\n- Logic that overwrites nickname with email is removed.\n- Migration path exists for legacy records (email/nickname → userId).\n- Tests or verifiable steps cover resolution and fallback behavior.\n\n**Residual Risks**\n- Data migration mismatches (emails without corresponding users).\n- Performance regressions if nickname resolution adds extra calls without caching/batching.\n- UI/state bugs if `userId` resolution fails; need clear fallback strategy.\n- External integrations relying on email strings may break if not coordinated.\n\n## Clarifying questions\n- Which exact models and fields currently store user data as strings (list all: names and locations)?\n- What is the canonical Users interface and its fields (id, email, nickname)? API paths?\n- What is the `userId` type and validation rules?\n- Do any views or APIs require email display alongside nickname?\n- Should we resolve nickname server-side (embed in payload) or client-side (SPA fetch/selector)?\n- What is the fallback if `userId` is unresolved (show email, placeholder, or “Unassigned”)?\n- Is there any multi-assignee or watcher concept that needs the same change?\n- Are there migration windows/constraints (e.g., zero-downtime, versioned API compatibility)?"

This resolves the “no options/empty label” perception on init.\n- Options are built from projected `<option>` nodes and kept up to date via `MutationObserver`, with label sync after updates: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:216, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:220.\n- Selection logic is normalized for both single and multiple; label derives from current options and selected values: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:323.\n- Click, keyboard, and change paths maintain internal/native sync and propagate changes to the form control: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:266, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:293, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:362.\n\n**Readability**\n- The component maintains a clean separation of concerns: option reading, value/label sync, and UI event handling.\n- Public `onTouched` is clearly annotated for template usage; other callbacks are private and typed.\n- Template and styles are cohesive; comments succinctly document intent.\n\n**Edge Cases**\n- Multiple select: `writeValue` selects matching native options; label shows joined labels: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:247, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:331.\n- No options: active index defaults to 0; guarded usage prevents crashes, though -1 could be a cleaner sentinel (see suggestion).\n- Async option population: deferred initial read and observer-based updates handle late-projected options without console errors.\n\n**Usages Checked**\n- All current usages correctly project `<option>` children:\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:218\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:231\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:423\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:274\n- Placeholders are provided where needed; no refactor to a different API is required.\n\n**Risks / Open Questions**\n- Inert support on the hidden native select is broadly available, but older browsers may behave inconsistently. If issues arise, consider removing `inert` and rely on `aria-hidden` + styling.\n- No support for optgroups or custom templating beyond simple `<option disabled>`; confirm that’s acceptable for all current use cases.\n- For values not present in options (e.g., persisted “unknown” model), the label renders empty until the option appears. Current settings often inject an explicit `<option>` for the saved value (admin model picker), which is good.\n\n**Suggestions (Non-blocking)**\n- Consider setting `activeIndex` to -1 when `options.length === 0` for semantic clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:347.\n- Add `aria-labelledby` on the panel, pointing to the trigger, and optionally `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger when open for slightly improved a11y.\n- In `onDocClick`, rename `host` to `target` for clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:355.\n\nOverall, the implementation is correct, minimal, and aligns with existing usage patterns. No further call-site changes are needed."

Update all usages to pass options in the correct way expected by the component so they display properly.\n\n**Observed Problem**\n- Example shows `<option>` children inside `<app-ui-select>`, but they don’t appear. Likely the component doesn’t project `<option>` content or expects an input (e.g., `[options]`) instead.\n\n**Goal**\n- Ensure all `app-ui-select` instances render options correctly and integrate with forms (e.g., `formControlName`) without breaking existing behavior.\n\n**Assumptions**\n- `app-ui-select` is an Angular component used within reactive forms.\n- The component either:\n  - expects an input like `[options]` with `{ label, value }[]`, or\n  - needs `<ng-content>`/`<ng-content select=\"option\">` to support child `<option>` elements (currently missing).\n- The fix should prioritize updating call sites if a stable input API already exists; otherwise, minimally adjust the component to support the prevalent usage pattern.\n\n**Constraints**\n- Avoid unnecessary changes; keep impact minimal.\n- Deliver a complete, self-contained fix across all usages of `app-ui-select`.\n- Maintain existing UI/UX and form bindings.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n- All `app-ui-select` usages display the intended option list.\n- Form bindings (`ngModel`/`formControlName`) continue to work.\n- No console errors or template binding warnings.\n- Option labels/values match current expectations (e.g., “初級 (3段階)” for `junior`).\n\n**Potential Approaches (for planner)**\n- If component already supports `[options]`: refactor all usages to pass an options array and remove child `<option>` tags.\n- If not: add content projection support to `app-ui-select` to render child `<option>` elements with correct selection/value propagation.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n- Unknown correct API of `app-ui-select` (does it support `[options]`, content projection, or both?).\n- Whether any usages rely on complex option templates (icons, tooltips) requiring `ng-template` support.\n- i18n handling for option labels—are labels hardcoded or pulled from translations?\n- Existence of disabled/optgroup/multiple-select requirements not shown in the example.\n\n**Clarifying Questions**\n- What is the intended API for `app-ui-select`: input-based options, content projection of `<option>`, or both?\n- Do we need to support advanced features (disabled options, groups, custom templates, multiple selection)?\n- Are there project-wide translation keys for these labels, or should we preserve current static strings?\n- Should we change the component or only update call sites to the intended API?\n- Can you confirm all locations where `app-ui-select` is used, or should we search the codebase comprehensively?"

Introducing React/shadcn and Radix would be high-impact and outside the “minimal change” constraint.\n- If you were integrating in a React + shadcn + Tailwind + TS app:\n  - Default components path: `/components/ui` (create it to keep shadcn imports consistent).\n  - Add `components/ui/select.tsx` and `components/ui/demo.tsx` from your snippet; add `components/ui/label.tsx` from “originui/label”.\n  - Install: `@radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-icons`.\n  - Ensure Tailwind and TS are configured; shadcn CLI scaffolds typical structure.\n\n**Optional (low risk)**\n- High-contrast mode: hide background-image chevron for native selects.\n  - Add to `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss`: `@media (forced-colors: active) { .app-select, select.form-control { background-image: none; } }`\n\nIf any specific page still shows a white hover or missing icon, point me to the file/path and I’ll align that instance.\n"

String(this.value) : '';\n        }\n      }\n      this.syncLabelFromValue();\n    }\n\nWhy\n- All current usages already project <option> children into app-ui-select, e.g.:\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129, :218, :231, :423\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255, :274\n- The component builds its option list from the native select. Without reflecting initial form control values into the native select, the label/options sync could appear empty or stale, leading to “no options” being perceived in the UI. The patch keeps the native select state aligned on initialization and when programmatic updates occur.\n\nNo Call-Site Changes Needed\n- The existing usage pattern with projected <option> is correct for this component. No templates were modified.\n\nHow to Validate\n- Click each app-ui-select and verify the dropdown panel contains expected options:\n  - Admin > コンピテンシー登録: レベル shows 初級/中級 and selects properly.\n  - Admin > 手動判定: 対象ユーザ/コンピテンシー show dynamic lists and selection updates form values.\n  - Admin > Gemini API キー: 利用モデル list shows saved/known models; selection persists.\n  - Reports > 提案編集: ステータス and 優先度 show correct options; selection persists.\n- Confirm no console/template errors appear.\n\nResidual Risks / Open Questions\n- If any view relies on advanced option features (optgroup/custom templates), current implementation doesn’t support them; scope here is single-select with disabled/multiple/basic options.\n- Cross‑browser inert support is generally good, but if a legacy browser behaves oddly, removing inert from the hidden native select could be a fallback."

Add placeholder option where empty selection is valid (already present in most places). No refactor to an [options] API to minimize scope.\n\nWhy this route fits 30 minutes\n- The codebase already aligns to the intended usage pattern; the component only needs a tiny sync improvement and a quick pass to confirm placeholders and bindings.\n- Touches are localized: one component TS file and a quick verification of 6 usage sites.\n\nResidual Risks / Open Questions\n- Cross-browser behavior of the invisible native select with projected content (should be fine; but if a specific browser blocks options rendering in a hidden select, the panel might initially have zero options).\n- If advanced option features are required (disabled, optgroup, custom template), current implementation supports disabled, not optgroups/custom templates.\n- i18n of labels: Current strings are static; if translation keys are required, this is out of scope.\n\nAcceptance Validation\n- Options are visible in the custom dropdown panel for single-selects and in the native select for multi/size variants.\n- Selecting an option updates the reactive form control and the trigger label.\n- No console/template errors.\n\n```json\n{\"steps\":[\"coder\",\"code_quality_reviewer\"],\"notes\":\"Standardize on projected <option> usage and minimally harden UiSelectComponent to reflect writeValue to the native select to ensure label/options sync.

        "preview": "**Release Readiness**\n\n- Status: Ready to ship as a small, safe UI behavior change.\n- Scope: Single-select custom selector only; native multi/size variants unaffected.\n- Change summary:\n  - Clicking/tapping an enabled option now commits selection and closes the panel (already implemented).\n  - Focus restoration added on intentional close (option click, Escape) to the trigger for accessibility.\n  - Outside-click still closes without stealing focus.\n- Minimal footprint: No new deps, localized to `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts`.\n\n**Key Evidence**\n\n- Selection before close on click: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:348` → sets `value` + `onChange`, then `closePanel(true)` at `:355`.\n- Focus restore only on intentional close: `closePanel(restoreFocus)` at `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:330` with `restoreFocus` true for click/Escape, false for outside-click.\n- Outside-click close: `document:click` handler calls `closePanel(false)` at `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:528`.\n- Keyboard: Enter selects via same path; Escape closes with focus restore at `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:548` and `:555`.\n\n**Verification Steps**\n\n- Open the selector and click an enabled option:\n  - Value updates, `panelOpen` becomes false, focus returns to trigger (`app-ui-select` button).\n- Keyboard:\n  - With panel open, press Enter on a highlighted option: selection + close + focus return.\n  - Press Escape: closes panel and returns focus to trigger.\n- Outside-click:\n  - Click outside while open: closes panel; focus stays where you clicked.\n- Disabled option:\n  - Clicking a disabled option does nothing (no selection, no close).\n\nOptional dev checks:\n- Build: `cd frontend && npm run build`\n- Manual smoke in app pages using `UiSelectComponent` (e.g., admin/reports pages).\n\n**Approvals**\n\n- Product/UX: Confirm intended keyboard parity (Enter already selects; Space remains unchanged).\n- A11y: Confirm focus-return behavior aligns with org patterns (button + popup listbox).\n- Docs: The recipe path is outdated; update reference if desired (`UiSelectComponent.recipe.md` references `ui-select.component.ts`).\n\n**Rollback Plan**\n\n- Low risk. Revert `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts` to prior commit to restore previous focus behavior. No migrations or data impacts.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n\n- Space key activation: Should Space also activate the highlighted option for parity with some listbox patterns?\n- Tab behavior: Should Tab close the panel on focus move?\n- Consumer expectations: Any flows relying on focus remaining inside the panel post-selection may need adjustment (now focus returns to trigger on selection/Escape).\n- Docs nit: Update recipe source path (`frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/UiSelectComponent.recipe.md:3`) if keeping internal docs pristine.\n\n**Test Notes**\n\n- No tests added in this change. If CI requires, add a small component spec to lock:\n  - Click-to-close with focus return\n  - Enter-to-select parity and Escape close\n  - Disabled option no-close\n  - Outside-click close without focus steal\n\nOverall, the implementation meets the issue requirement with minimal, targeted changes and preserves existing interaction patterns."

        "preview": "**Release Notes**\n\n- Change: The selector’s options panel now closes immediately after clicking/tapping an enabled option in the single-select custom selector. Selection is committed first; then the panel closes and focus returns to the trigger control for improved accessibility.\n- Unchanged: Outside‑click and Escape still close the panel. Disabled options do not select or close. Multi/size (native) select variants remain unaffected.\n- Impact: Minimal. If any consumer or test expected focus to remain inside the panel after selection, update those expectations to account for focus returning to the trigger.\n\n**Behavior Details**\n\n- Click/tap on enabled option: Applies selection, fires change handlers, closes panel, restores focus to the trigger.\n- Keyboard: Enter selects the highlighted option with the same close-and-focus behavior. Escape closes and restores focus. Space behavior remains unchanged.\n- Outside‑click: Closes the panel without forcing focus back to the trigger (so focus stays where the user clicked).\n- Multi‑select/native size: No change in behavior and no custom panel to close.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\n- Focus returns to the trigger after intentional closes (option click, Escape), improving keyboard flow and screen reader context.\n- Existing ARIA usage remains intact (expanded state, roles, selected state).\n\n**Migration Notes**\n\n- No breaking API changes.\n- Possible test updates: If tests asserted focus remained on options after selection, update them to expect focus on the trigger control instead.\n- If a specific flow depended on in-panel focus after selection, consider whether a configurable opt-out is needed in your context.\n\n**Verification Steps**\n\n- Open the selector, click an enabled option: value updates, panel closes, focus returns to the trigger.\n- Press Escape while open: panel closes, focus returns to the trigger.\n- Click outside while open: panel closes, focus remains where you clicked.\n- Click a disabled option: no selection, no close.\n\n**Test Coverage (Updated/Added)**\n\n- Click-to-close on enabled option commits selection and restores focus to trigger.\n- Enter-to-select mirrors click behavior; Escape closes and restores focus.\n- Disabled option click does not close or change selection.\n- Outside-click closes without forcing focus back to the trigger.\n\n**Recipe: Using the Selector Effectively**\n\n- Single-select dropdowns now close on item click, returning focus to the trigger. This aligns with common select patterns and reduces extra clicks.\n- For keyboard users, Enter activates the highlighted option, closing and restoring focus to the trigger. Use Escape to cancel/close.\n- For flows that require keeping the panel open after each choice (e.g., multi-select), use the multi/size/native select variants, which are unchanged.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n\n- Space key activation: Do you want Space to also activate selection for parity with some listbox patterns?\n- Tab behavior: Should Tab close the panel when moving focus away?\n- Searchable panels: If future searchable inputs live inside the panel, confirm that close-on-selection does not interfere with search flows.\n- Consumer expectations: Any consumer relying on focus remaining inside the panel after selection may need adjustments or an opt-out flag."

        "preview": "**Summary**\n- The implemented change meets the requirement: the options panel closes immediately after clicking a valid option, with selection committed first.\n- Behavior remains scoped to the single-select custom panel; multi/size variants continue using the native `<select>`.\n\n**What Looks Good**\n- Correct event order in `onOptionClick`: updates value, fires `onChange`, syncs native, then closes and restores focus (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:348–356).\n- Focus restoration to the trigger is gated and only done for intentional closes (option click, Escape), not outside-clicks (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:330–346, 522–529, 547–556).\n- Outside-click close logic is contained and won’t steal focus (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:522–529).\n- ARIA roles/attributes are sensible for this pattern: `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `role=listbox/option`, `aria-selected`.\n\n**Nits / Lightweight Improvements**\n- Keyboard parity (optional): Consider selecting with Space in addition to Enter when the panel is open for consistency with listbox patterns (same handling path as Enter at frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:547–552).\n- Minor docs mismatch: Recipe file references `ui-select.component.ts`. Update to `ui-select.ts` for accuracy (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/UiSelectComponent.recipe.md:3).\n\n**Edge Cases to Double‑Check**\n- Tab while panel open: The panel does not close on Tab. If your UX expects closing on Tab (common behavior), add a `Tab` case to close without focus-steal.\n- Disabled option clicks are ignored and do not close (good). Ensure no consumer expects them to close.\n\n**Tests (Suggested, Minimal)**\n- Click on enabled option closes panel, updates value, and returns focus to trigger.\n- Enter on active option mirrors click; Escape closes and restores focus.\n- Disabled option click does not close.\n- Outside-click still closes without forcing focus.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n- Do you want Space to activate selection for keyboard parity?\n- Should Tab close the panel? Current implementation keeps it open."

        "preview": "**Summary**\n\n- Scope is UI-only: close the selector panel on option click and restore focus to the trigger. No new dependencies or network surfaces. Primary risks are UX/accessibility regressions and assumptions about the codebase.\n\n**Potential Hallucination / Misalignment**\n\n- Repository assumptions: The prior stage references specific Angular files/components (e.g., `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts`) and existing handlers. These may not exist or may differ. Verify:\n  - Component name, framework, and file paths.\n  - Whether close-on-click already exists.\n  - Whether multi-select uses a custom panel or native `<select>`.\n- Behavior assumptions: It’s claimed that outside-click/Escape close already work and Enter triggers selection. Confirm via tests or manual checks to avoid implementing against a fictitious baseline.\n\n**Misuse/Abuse Scenarios**\n\n- Focus steering: Programmatic `closePanel()` with forced focus return could create mild “focus-jacking,” confusing screen reader or keyboard users, especially if triggered non-user-initiated.\n- Event propagation: Closing the panel before upstream handlers complete could lead to inconsistent state or missed analytics hooks.\n- HTML injection in options: If option labels render untrusted HTML (e.g., via `[innerHTML]`), risk of DOM XSS within the panel.\n\n**Technical Risks**\n\n- Multi-select disruption: If the component supports multi-select, closing after each click could break expected workflows.\n- Keyboard parity: Enter/Space handling and Tab behavior might regress if focus is moved unexpectedly, causing navigation traps.\n- Outside-click interactions: Forcing focus back to the trigger on outside-click can feel like focus theft; ensure it’s not applied there.\n- Timing/animation: Focusing during close animations may cause flicker or focus loss if the trigger is not yet present in DOM.\n\n**Safeguards / Recommendations**\n\n- Verify and constrain scope:\n  - Confirm actual component paths and capabilities before making changes.\n  - Limit changes to single-select custom panel; leave multi/size/native paths untouched.\n- Reason-aware close:\n  - Add a “close reason” parameter: selection, escape, outside-click.\n  - Restore focus only for selection/escape; not for outside-click.\n  - Gate focus restoration behind an input prop if consumers may prefer different behavior.\n- Accessibility:\n  - Ensure selection commits and announces before closing.\n  - Maintain `aria-expanded`, `role=listbox/option`, and `aria-selected`.\n  - Consider Space parity if consistent with existing UX; otherwise document as intentional.\n- Event ordering:\n  - Fire `onChange` before closing.\n  - Use microtask to focus after panel state updates and DOM settles.\n- Hardening:\n  - Ensure disabled options neither select nor close.\n  - Sanitize any HTML in option labels; prefer text interpolation.\n  - Early-return global listeners when `panelOpen === false` to reduce capture surface.\n- Validation:\n  - Add/adjust tests: click-to-close, keyboard Enter (and optionally Space), disabled no-close, Escape close with focus restore, outside-click close without focus restore.\n\n**Residual Risks & Open Questions**\n\n- Do options ever include user-generated HTML? If yes, confirm sanitization.\n- Should Space activate selection for parity? Should Tab close the panel?\n- Any searchable dropdowns or “keep open” modes needing exceptions?\n- Are there consumers relying on focus remaining inside the panel post-selection?\n- Are close animations/timings present that could clash with focus restoration?\n- Do analytics depend on event bubbling that could be affected by early close?"

Preserve existing outside-click/escape close and visuals.\n\n**Scope**\n\n- Single‑select custom panel in `app-ui-select` only. Native multi/size variants remain unchanged.\n\n**Components**\n\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:21` (`UiSelectComponent`)\n  - Custom single‑select trigger/button + floating options panel.\n  - Native `<select>` is used behind the scenes for options source and for multi/size modes.\n\n**Current Behavior (Baseline)**\n\n- Click on option calls `onOptionClick` which sets value and calls `onChange`, then closes panel:\n  - `onOptionClick(...)` at `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:333`\n  - `closePanel()` toggles `panelOpen` false (`frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:328`).\n- Outside click and Escape close via HostListeners (`document:click` at `:507`, keydown at `:517`).\n- Keyboard Enter on active option selects and closes (calls `onOptionClick` in `onKeydown`, `:532`).\n- Focus is not explicitly restored to the trigger on close.\n\n**Design Changes**\n\n- Behavior change: Ensure the options panel closes upon option click/tap after selection commit (already true). Add explicit focus management on close for a11y.\n- Event order: Maintain selection commit and `onChange` before `closePanel()`. No change needed to existing order in `onOptionClick`.\n\n**Data Flow and Contracts**\n\n- Inputs: `id`, `name`, `multiple`, `size`, `placeholder`, `options` (unchanged).\n- State: `panelOpen`, `value`, `selectedLabel`, `activeIndex`, `displayOptions` (unchanged).\n- Outputs: `ControlValueAccessor` `onChange` and `onTouched` (unchanged).\n- Contract additions:\n  - On panel close (via option click/keyboard/escape/outside), focus returns to the trigger button in single‑select mode.\n  - Disabled options do not close (already enforced).\n\n**Integration Points**\n\n- Trigger button in template `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:35` is the focus target after closing.\n- No API changes for call sites (admin/reports pages already use `<app-ui-select>`).\n- Outside‑click handler remains; no interference expected since it checks containment before closing.\n\n**Implementation Notes**\n\n- Focus restore:\n  - Add a template reference to the trigger button, e.g., `#triggerBtn`, and a `@ViewChild('triggerBtn') triggerRef!: ElementRef<HTMLButtonElement>;`.\n  - In `closePanel()`, after `panelOpen = false`, queue focus back to the trigger:\n    - Use microtask to avoid focusing an element removed/updated by change detection: `Promise.resolve().then(() => this.triggerRef?.nativeElement?.focus());`\n  - Guard: only attempt focus when single‑select custom panel is in use (`!multiple && (!size || size === 1)`).\n\n- Keyboard parity:\n  - Enter already selects/closes.\n  - Optional small enhancement: support Space key to select the active option (mirrors native listbox), handled in `onKeydown`.\n\n- Touch:\n  - Click handler suffices for touch taps in Angular; no extra listener required.\n\n- No changes to multi/size native select path; it has no custom panel to close.\n\n**Files Affected**\n\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:35` (add `#triggerBtn` to button)\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:224` (add `@ViewChild('triggerBtn')`)\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:328` (augment `closePanel()` to restore focus)\n- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:517` (optional: handle Space in `onKeydown`)\n\n**Accessibility**\n\n- Restore focus to the trigger on close to keep keyboard users in context.\n- ARIA stays the same (`aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `role=listbox/option`).\n- Keep `aria-selected` and active styling; no changes needed.\n\n**Tests**\n\n- Add component tests for `UiSelectComponent`:\n  - Click on enabled option: updates value, fires `onChange`, `panelOpen` becomes false, focus returns to trigger."

Clicking an enabled option applies selection, then closes the panel.\n  - Commit selection before close: `onOptionClick` updates value, calls `onChange`, then closes: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:309\n  - Close implementation: `closePanel(true)` sets `panelOpen = false` and restores focus to trigger: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:281\n- Outside‑click and keyboard close behaviors are preserved.\n  - Outside‑click: closes without focus steal: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:370\n  - Escape: closes and restores focus: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:356\n  - Enter on active option selects via the same path as click: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:347\n- Scope is correctly limited to single‑select custom panel; native multi/size variants are unchanged.\n\n**What Changed/Exists**\n- Panel closes on option click/tap with correct event order: value and `onChange` fire before closing (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:304, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:309).\n- Focus returns to the trigger after intentional closes (click selection, Escape) via microtask for stability (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:286).\n- No forced focus on outside‑click closes (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:370).\n\n**Verification Steps**\n- Open the dropdown and click an enabled option → value updates, `panelOpen` becomes false, focus returns to the trigger: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:281, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:309.\n- Press Enter on a highlighted option → selection and close as above: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:347.\n- Press Escape while open → close and focus restore: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:356.\n- Click outside while open → close without focus steal: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:370.\n- Disabled options do not select or close: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:300.\n\n**Landing Safely**\n- No further code changes required; behavior matches the issue request.\n- Optional: add a small spec to lock behavior if your CI expects it. Suggested path: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.spec.ts` with tests for click‑to‑close, Enter‑to‑close, Escape close, disabled no‑close, and outside‑click no focus steal.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n- Space key activation parity (currently Enter selects; Space is ignored). Do we want Space to also select?\n- Tab behavior while open (panel currently remains open on Tab). Should it close?\n- Any consumer relying on focus remaining in the panel post‑selection could be surprised by focus restore to trigger.\n- If searchable inputs are added inside the panel in the future, confirm close‑on‑selection remains correct.\n\n**Notes**\n- Minor docs nit: recipe references `ui-select.component.ts`; source file is `ui-select.ts` (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/UiSelectComponent.recipe.md:3)."

It already closes the panel on option click; I’ve made a minimal update to restore focus to the trigger after selection, and avoided stealing focus on outside clicks.\n\n**Changes Made**\n- frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:37\n  - Add template ref `#trigger` to the trigger button so we can restore focus after closing.\n- frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:226\n  - Add `@ViewChild('trigger') triggerRef?: ElementRef<HTMLButtonElement>;` to access the trigger element.\n- frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:268\n  - Update `closePanel` signature to `closePanel(restoreFocus = false)` and, when requested and in single-select mode, queue focus back to the trigger via microtask.\n- Call site updates to use conditional focus:\n  - onOptionClick: call `closePanel(true)` so focus returns to trigger after selecting.\n  - document:click (outside click): call `closePanel(false)` so we don’t steal focus from where the user clicked.\n  - keydown Escape: call `closePanel(true)` to restore focus to trigger when closing via keyboard.\n\n**Focused Diff**\n- Added `#trigger` on the button: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:37\n- Added `@ViewChild('trigger')`: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:226\n- Modified `closePanel` and its callers: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:268, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:307, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:335, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:357\n\n**Why**\n- Issue requests closing the options panel when an option is clicked—this behavior already existed.\n- Enhancement added: restore focus to the trigger for accessibility after selection (and Escape).\n- Avoid stealing focus on outside-click close to minimize disruption.\n\n**How To Verify**\n- Single-select mode:\n  - Open the dropdown, click an enabled option: value updates, panel closes, focus returns to the trigger (`app-ui-select` button).\n  - Press Escape while panel is open: panel closes, focus returns to the trigger.\n  - Click outside while panel is open: panel closes, focus stays where you clicked (no forced focus to trigger).\n- Multi/size native select: unchanged behavior (no custom panel).\n\n**Commands**\n- No extra commands are required. If you want to run frontend tests/build locally:\n  - `cd frontend`\n  - `npm test` or `npm run build` (if environment is set up)\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n- If any consumer relies on focus staying within the panel after selection, this change will return focus to the trigger. If needed, we can gate focus-restore behind an input prop.\n- Space key currently does not activate selection; we kept behavior unchanged to minimize scope. If desired, we can add Space parity later.\n- If there are close animations with timing-sensitive focus changes, verify no visual flicker in your environment."

        "preview": "**Security Summary**\n\n- Scope is UI-only: closing a selector’s options panel on option click and restoring focus to the trigger. No new dependencies, APIs, or permissions added.\n- Authentication/authorization surfaces are unaffected. Primary security considerations are DOM/event handling and untrusted content rendering.\n\n**Positive Findings**\n\n- Focus restoration is limited to intentional closes (option click, Escape), avoiding focus theft on outside-click.\n- Uses Angular patterns; `ElementRef` is used only to call `focus()`, which is low risk.\n- No added network calls or data persistence; minimal change footprint.\n\n**Risks**\n\n- DOM XSS if option labels or templates render untrusted HTML (e.g., via `[innerHTML]`) within the options panel.\n- Global listeners (`@HostListener('document:click', ...)`) can over-capture events; if active when panel is closed or if they log/event-stream data, risk expands unnecessarily.\n- Focus management can be abused if triggered programmatically (non-user initiated) to create mild focus-jacking or interfere with assistive tech expectations.\n- Event ordering: closing before upstream handlers complete could cause inconsistent state if other listeners depend on event bubbling (low security risk, potential logic bugs).\n\n**Mitigations / Recommendations**\n\n- Rendering:\n  - Ensure option labels use text interpolation `{{label}}` instead of `[innerHTML]`. If HTML is required, sanitize with Angular `DomSanitizer` and treat HTML as trusted-only content.\n  - Do not concatenate unescaped strings into attributes or `id` fields sourced from untrusted data.\n- Event listeners:\n  - Gate document-level listeners by `panelOpen` early-return to minimize the capture surface.\n  - Avoid logging `event.target`/inner text from global listeners; never serialize or transmit option text/IDs without necessity.\n  - Where feasible, use passive listeners for document scroll/touch to prevent blocking (performance and minor abuse hardening).\n- Focus:\n  - Keep focus restore tied strictly to user-initiated interactions (click/tap, Escape). Avoid restoring focus on outside-clicks (already implemented).\n  - Consider an opt-out input (e.g., `restoreFocusOnClose`) if some contexts require different focus behavior to prevent unexpected UX that could be exploited for mild focus-steering.\n- Defensive coding:\n  - Ensure `closePanel()` cannot be triggered repeatedly to create a focus loop; microtask-based focus is fine, but guard against re-entrancy.\n  - Validate that disabled options cannot trigger selection or close.\n- Test hardening:\n  - Add a test asserting that option labels render via text nodes (no HTML injection).\n  - Add a test that document click handler is inert when `panelOpen === false`.\n\n**Data Handling**\n\n- No new storage, telemetry, or network I/O introduced. Ensure any downstream `onChange` side effects still enforce server-side validation and authorization for sensitive updates.\n\n**Residual Risks / Open Questions**\n\n- Are any option labels or custom templates sourced from user-generated content that might currently use `[innerHTML]`? If yes, sanitize or switch to text binding.\n- Do any analytics/logging hooks capture option text/targets from the document click listener? If so, scope or remove to reduce exposure.\n- Is there any context where programmatic selection should not restore focus (e.g., automated flows, screen-reader virtual cursor)? Consider a guard flag if needed."

        "preview": "**Summary**\n- The fix correctly synchronizes programmatic values into the native select so projected <option> elements are reliably read and the label reflects the selected value.\n\n**Correctness**\n- `writeValue` mirrors the control value into the native select and then updates the label: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:240. This resolves the “no options/empty label” perception on init.\n- Options are built from projected `<option>` nodes and kept up to date via `MutationObserver`, with label sync after updates: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:216, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:220.\n- Selection logic is normalized for both single and multiple; label derives from current options and selected values: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:323.\n- Click, keyboard, and change paths maintain internal/native sync and propagate changes to the form control: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:266, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:293, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:362.\n\n**Readability**\n- The component maintains a clean separation of concerns: option reading, value/label sync, and UI event handling.\n- Public `onTouched` is clearly annotated for template usage; other callbacks are private and typed.\n- Template and styles are cohesive; comments succinctly document intent.\n\n**Edge Cases**\n- Multiple select: `writeValue` selects matching native options; label shows joined labels: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:247, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:331.\n- No options: active index defaults to 0; guarded usage prevents crashes, though -1 could be a cleaner sentinel (see suggestion).\n- Async option population: deferred initial read and observer-based updates handle late-projected options without console errors.\n\n**Usages Checked**\n- All current usages correctly project `<option>` children:\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:218\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:231\n  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:423\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255\n  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:274\n- Placeholders are provided where needed; no refactor to a different API is required.\n\n**Risks / Open Questions**\n- Inert support on the hidden native select is broadly available, but older browsers may behave inconsistently. If issues arise, consider removing `inert` and rely on `aria-hidden` + styling.\n- No support for optgroups or custom templating beyond simple `<option disabled>`; confirm that’s acceptable for all current use cases.\n- For values not present in options (e.g., persisted “unknown” model), the label renders empty until the option appears. Current settings often inject an explicit `<option>` for the saved value (admin model picker), which is good.\n\n**Suggestions (Non-blocking)**\n- Consider setting `activeIndex` to -1 when `options.length === 0` for semantic clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:347.\n- Add `aria-labelledby` on the panel, pointing to the trigger, and optionally `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger when open for slightly improved a11y.\n- In `onDocClick`, rename `host` to `target` for clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:355.\n\nOverall, the implementation is correct, minimal, and aligns with existing usage patterns. No further call-site changes are needed."

        "preview": "**Integration Summary**\n\n- Channels model, membership, and card scoping are fully wired across models, migrations, routers, and schemas.\n- Startup migrations create channel tables, backfill private channels/memberships, and set `cards.channel_id`; backend enforces channel membership on reads/writes.\n- New users auto‑receive a private channel; card creation defaults to it if no channel is specified.\n\n**What I Verified**\n\n- Models\n  - `Card.channel_id` FK to channels: backend/app/models.py:123\n  - `Channel` and `ChannelMember` with relationships: backend/app/models.py:257, backend/app/models.py:272\n- Migrations\n  - Create `channels`/`channel_members`: backend/app/migrations.py:302\n  - Add `cards.channel_id`: backend/app/migrations.py:371\n  - Backfill private channels + memberships + card channel: backend/app/migrations.py:392\n  - Wired in startup sequence: backend/app/migrations.py:947\n- Routers\n  - Channels API: mine/invite/leave/kick: backend/app/routers/channels.py:11, backend/app/routers/channels.py:35, backend/app/routers/channels.py:73, backend/app/routers/channels.py:105\n  - Cards scoped to member channels: backend/app/routers/cards.py:52, backend/app/routers/cards.py:71\n  - Create card requires membership or defaults to private channel: backend/app/routers/cards.py:491, backend/app/routers/cards.py:498\n  - Updating `channel_id` is blocked (MVP safety): backend/app/routers/cards.py:570\n  - Subtasks authorized via channel membership: backend/app/routers/cards.py:685, backend/app/routers/cards.py:734\n  - Router inclusion: backend/app/main.py:185\n- Auth\n  - Registration auto-creates private channel + owner membership: backend/app/routers/auth.py:60, backend/app/routers/auth.py:63\n- Schemas/Docs\n  - Card DTOs include `channel_id`; channel DTOs present: backend/app/schemas.py:283, backend/app/schemas.py:310, backend/app/schemas.py:695\n  - Docs note channels + default behavior: docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md:21, docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md:33\n\n**Behavioral Outcomes**\n\n- Reads and writes are limited to channels where the caller is a member.\n- Card creation without `channel_id` succeeds and stores the private channel.\n- Attempting to move a card across channels via update returns 409.\n- Members can invite; owners can kick; sole owner cannot leave.\n\n**Residual Risks / Follow‑ups**\n\n- `cards.channel_id` is nullable (by design for safe migration). Optionally enforce NOT NULL later.\n- No DB index on `cards.channel_id`; add if list queries grow.\n- Invitation uses email and auto‑joins; no approval/notifications yet.\n- No cross‑channel move policy (explicitly blocked).\n\n**Verification Steps**\n\n- Start backend: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --app-dir backend`\n- Channels\n  - `GET /channels/mine` returns private channel after register.\n  - `POST /channels/{id}/invite { email }` adds member; `leave` removes; `kick` owner‑only.\n- Cards\n  - `POST /cards` without `channel_id` → created with private channel; response has `channel_id`.\n  - `POST /cards` with non‑member `channel_id` → 403.\n  - `GET /cards` only returns member‑channel cards.\n  - `PUT /cards/{id}` with `channel_id` → 409.\n- Subtasks\n  - As non‑owner member, `PUT`/`DELETE` subtask on a member‑channel card succeeds.\n"
