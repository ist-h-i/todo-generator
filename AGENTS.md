# Repository Guidelines

This repository keeps language-agnostic standards separate from Angular-specific rules so that each team can focus on the guidance that matters to them.

## Quick Links

- [Development Governance Handbook](docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md)
- [Angular Coding & Design Guidelines](docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md)
- [UI Design System](docs/ui-design-system.md)
- [UI Layout Requirements](docs/ui-layout-requirements.md)

## How to Use These Guides

- Start with the **Development Governance Handbook** for repository structure, backend practices, quality gates, and AI-driven expectations.
- Apply the **Angular Coding & Design Guidelines** whenever you touch the SPA. They consolidate coding standards, state management rules, and the most important design-system requirements.
- Keep design and workflow docs in sync when updating components, flows, or build tooling. Document intentional deviations so the next contributor inherits accurate context.
