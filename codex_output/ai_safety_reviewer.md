**Summary**
- Change is a localized UI layout update (flex row â†’ column) for subtask cards. No new data flows, APIs, or dependencies introduced.

**Prompt-Leak & Output Risks**
- PR/commit text and screenshots could inadvertently include sensitive task content or internal instructions.
- Vertical stacking may reveal more text if truncation/wrapping classes are altered or removed.
- DOM reordering can break tests that snapshot actual user data.
- If `[innerHTML]` appears elsewhere for `title`/`status`, XSS risk increases.
- Debug logs or console output tied to the board could expose task data during review or CI logs.

**Mitigations**
- Keep truncation/wrapping utilities on content (e.g., `truncate`, `line-clamp-*`, `break-words`) unchanged.
- Use plain Angular interpolation for text; avoid `[innerHTML]` for `subtask.title`/`column.title`. If needed, sanitize.
- Redact/anonymize data in PR descriptions, screenshots, and test fixtures; do not paste internal prompts or pipeline details.
- Update tests to query by role/label/test id rather than positional indices; avoid snapshots with real data.
- Ensure no new logs are added; keep existing logging minimal and non-sensitive.

**Accessibility & Usability**
- Status placed before content in DOM aligns visual and reading order (good). Verify badge contrast and legibility; adjust if below WCAG thresholds.

**Decision**
- Approved with conditions: preserve truncation and interpolation; anonymize artifacts; avoid leaking internal context in PR materials.
