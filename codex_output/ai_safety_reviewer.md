**Safety Summary**
- Scope is a UI-only layout tweak: stack Status above Content for subtask cards on the Board. No new data, APIs, or storage paths.
- Primary risks are XSS via rendering, authZ reliance on UI, and accidental leakage through logs/PRs. Overall risk is low with proper guardrails.

**Key Risks**
- XSS/content injection: Rendering user-entered titles/descriptions or status names unsafely (e.g., `[innerHTML]`) could execute scripts.
- AuthZ bypass: If UI exposes status updates without server-side checks, users could attempt unauthorized changes.
- Accessibility drift: Visual-only reordering without DOM order changes can confuse AT and tests.
- Selector fragility: Tests or CSS relying on sibling order/class strings may break and cause unintended UI states.
- UI DoS/layout: Long content may push status off-screen or create overlap in dense lists.
- Prompt-leak/process: PRs, comments, or code should not include internal instructions or model/system prompts.

**Mitigations**
- Rendering safety: Use Angular interpolation `{{ ... }}` for text. Do not introduce `[innerHTML]`. If styles are data-driven, constrain to safe formats and rely on Angular sanitization.
- Authorization: Confirm backend enforces ownership/role checks on status updates; do not rely on UI gating alone (aligns with repo Security tips).
- DOM order: Place Status before Content in the DOM and switch to `flex flex-col items-start gap-2`; avoid CSS-only reordering for a11y/tab order.
- Scope control: Apply class/DOM changes only within the subtask card template to avoid global regressions where the same class string might exist.
- Layout stability: Preserve existing truncation/wrapping (`break-words`, any line clamps). Keep compact spacing; remove `justify-between` to avoid vertical stretching.
- Logging/telemetry: Avoid logging raw content in debug; use IDs/status codes only. Ensure screenshots/tests use synthetic data.
- Tests/selectors: Prefer stable selectors (`data-testid`) rather than depending on element order or specific Tailwind class combinations.

**Prompt-Leak and Process Hygiene**
- Do not include internal prompts, chain-of-thought, or operational instructions in code comments, commit messages, or PR text.
- PR screenshots should use synthetic tasks; exclude real user data and secrets.

**Verdict**
- Safe to proceed with the minimal Tailwind class update and DOM reorder, provided the above mitigations are observed. No additional privacy or security approvals needed for this UI-only change.
