**AI Safety Review**

- Change scope is lint config + docs; no runtime data flows added.
- Primary safety impact is positive: discourages `any` and promotes typed boundaries.

**Prompt/Secret Leak Risks**

- Docs/examples could inadvertently include sensitive values (tokens, URLs, PII) if not curated.
- Inline ESLint disable comments may contain internal ticket IDs or context; acceptable in source, but avoid linking to private systems in public repos.
- PR descriptions might paste internal prompts or agent analysis; keep to high-level rationale only.
- Negative test instructions (temporary `: any` files) must not be committed.

**Output Safety Risks**

- CI lint errors echo code snippets; ensure repo contains no secrets to avoid exposure in logs.
- Template `$any(...)` casts remain and can mask unsafe flows; out of scope here but worth tracking.

**Mitigations**

- Keep docs examples generic and non-PII; use fake names/emails and neutral endpoints.
- Require suppression comments to be minimal and generic; avoid internal links in public repos.
- Add a PR checklist note: “No secrets in code, logs, docs, or examples; no internal prompts included.”
- For follow-up, consider `@angular-eslint/template/no-any` (warn) to reduce template casts.
- Ensure negative test files for lint are local-only and excluded from commits.

**Verdict**

- Low risk of prompt or secret leakage from this change as proposed. Approved with the above hygiene notes.
