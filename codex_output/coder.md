Summary
- Channels are already implemented across models, migrations, schemas, routers, and startup wiring.
- I fixed two remaining ownership checks so channel members can update/delete subtasks.

What I changed
- backend/app/routers/cards.py: Updated subtask endpoints to authorize by channel membership instead of card ownership.
  - update_subtask: replaced owner-only gate with _get_accessible_card(db, user_id=current_user.id, card_id=card_id)
    - File: backend/app/routers/cards.py:595
  - delete_subtask: replaced owner-only gate with _get_accessible_card(db, user_id=current_user.id, card_id=card_id)
    - File: backend/app/routers/cards.py:640

Verification (suggested)
- Start backend: uvicorn app.main:app --reload --app-dir backend
- Smoke test channels:
  - Register/login → GET /channels/mine returns private channel.
  - POST /channels/{channelId}/invite { email } → invitee sees channel in /channels/mine.
  - POST /channels/{channelId}/leave and POST /channels/{channelId}/kick behave per policy.
- Cards:
  - POST /cards without channel_id creates in private channel; response includes channel_id.
  - GET /cards only returns cards in member channels.
  - PUT /cards/{id} with channel_id → 409 Conflict.
- Subtasks (fix target):
  - As a non-owner member of the channel, PUT /cards/{cardId}/subtasks/{subtaskId} succeeds.
  - As a non-owner member of the channel, DELETE /cards/{cardId}/subtasks/{subtaskId} succeeds.

Notes on current implementation
- Models: Channel and ChannelMember exist; cards include channel_id and relationship.
  - backend/app/models.py:123 (Card.channel_id), 256 (Channel), 271 (ChannelMember)
- Migrations: Idempotently create channel tables, add cards.channel_id, auto-create private channels/memberships, and backfill cards.
  - backend/app/migrations.py:302–520, 920–980
- Routers:
  - Channels API: /channels/mine, /{id}/invite, /{id}/leave, /{id}/kick.
    - backend/app/routers/channels.py:1
  - Cards scoped by channel membership for list/detail/create/update/delete/similar/feedback.
    - backend/app/routers/cards.py:52 (_member_channel_ids), 61 (_card_query), 260 (_get_accessible_card)
    - Creation defaults to private channel if none provided.
- Schemas updated for channel fields and channel DTOs.
  - backend/app/schemas.py:283, 310, 687–700
- Startup wiring includes channel migrations and router registration.
  - backend/app/main.py:25, 185

Residual risks / open questions
- cards.channel_id is nullable; enforcing NOT NULL post-backfill is deferred.
- No card cross-channel moves yet; policy/audit TBD.
- Owner-leave behavior blocks sole owner leaving; owner transfer is out of scope.
- Channel invite accepts email and auto-joins; no approval/notifications.

If you want, I can:
- Add a DB index for cards.channel_id if list performance needs it.
- Extend tests to cover the updated subtask authorization paths.
