I’ve scanned the frontend for explicit any, checked TS/ESLint settings, and reviewed the Angular docs. The repo already contains the targeted changes outlined by earlier stages, so no additional code edits are necessary.

Findings
- TypeScript any usage:
  - Code: Only `writeValue(obj: any)` in `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:205` (required by ControlValueAccessor).
  - Templates: Multiple `$any(...)` casts across feature templates (scoped to `.html`).
- Typing fix already present:
  - `value` is typed as `string | string[] | null` and conversions are contained within the component.
- Lint enforcement:
  - `frontend/.eslintrc.cjs` enforces `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: error` with a file-scoped override only for `src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts` to permit `writeValue(any)`.
- TS config:
  - `frontend/tsconfig.json` has `strict: true` and strict Angular template checking enabled.
- Documentation:
  - `docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md` and `docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md` both document “no explicit any”, preference for unknown/generics, and the narrow ControlValueAccessor exception.

No Changes Required
- Code and docs already align with the stated objectives. I did not apply any patch to avoid unnecessary churn.

Validation Commands
- Search for any in TS (excludes templates):
  - rg -n "\bany\b" frontend/src --type-add 'ts:*.ts' -t ts -S | rg -v "\.html:"
- Lint/build/tests:
  - cd frontend && npm run lint
  - cd frontend && npm run build
  - cd frontend && npm test -- --watch=false

Residual Risks / Open Questions
- Template `$any(...)` casts remain. Safe removal requires typing FormControls and event targets per template; recommend incremental cleanup.
- Acceptance criteria: If “zero any” applies to TS code only, this meets it (with the framework-required exception). If it includes template `$any`, that needs a broader follow-up.
- Confirm whether to base on or supersede PR #507; current tree appears consistent with the planned changes.

If you want, I can scope and remove a small batch of `$any(...)` casts in one feature template as a follow-up with minimal diff.
