Summary
- The repository-wide index already exists and is cross‑linked correctly.
- No additional edits are needed to satisfy the request with minimal impact.

What I verified
- Index file present and comprehensive:
  - docs/INDEX.md:1
    - Includes Quick Pointers for governance, Angular guidelines, UI design/layout.
    - Maps top-level areas (frontend, backend, docs, scripts, CI).
    - Search Tips include a correct Angular route pattern: export const .*Routes|appRoutes|Routes\s*=\s*\[ targeting frontend/src/app.
- Root README links to the index and Quick Links:
  - README.md:150
  - README.md:151
  - README.md:152
  - README.md:153
  - README.md:154
- Docs README cross‑links to the index:
  - docs/README.md:42
- Quick Links targets exist:
  - docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md:1
  - docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md:1
  - docs/ui-design-system.md:1
  - docs/ui-layout-requirements.md:1

Commands run
- List repo and docs:
  - ls -la
  - ls -la docs
- Confirm cross-links:
  - rg -n "\[Repository Index & Map\]\(docs/INDEX.md\)" README.md
  - rg -n "\[Repository Index & Map\]\(INDEX.md\)" docs/README.md
- Confirm Quick Links targets exist:
  - test -f docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md
  - test -f docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md
  - test -f docs/ui-design-system.md
  - test -f docs/ui-layout-requirements.md
- Validate Angular routes file presence and search tip applicability:
  - test -f frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts

Result
- The repository already contains a concise, accurate index at docs/INDEX.md with correct cross‑links in README.md and docs/README.md. This fulfills the “project-wide index with minimal changes” requirement. No patch is necessary.

Residual notes
- Keep docs/INDEX.md updated when adding new top-level directories to avoid staleness.
- If routing conventions change (e.g., different route variable names), update the Search Tips pattern in docs/INDEX.md accordingly.
