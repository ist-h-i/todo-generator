**Summary**
- Delivered a repository-wide, newcomer-friendly index with minimal impact.
- Completed by refining links in the existing index and confirming cross-links in READMEs.

**What I Changed**
- Made Quick Pointers and See Also in docs/INDEX.md fully clickable with correct relative paths.
  - docs/INDEX.md
    - Linked to docs/README.md, ui/design docs, governance, and angular guidelines.
    - Linked to root README via ../README.md.

**Why This Meets The Goal**
- New contributors can jump directly to key areas (frontend routes, backend routers/services, UI standards, governance) in 1–2 clicks.
- Minimal diff and no structural changes; existing content preserved.

**Verification**
- Confirm the index exists and links are present:
  - `test -f docs/INDEX.md`
  - `rg -n \"\\[Documentation Index\\]\\(README.md\\)\" docs/INDEX.md`
  - `rg -n \"\\(../README.md\\)\" docs/INDEX.md`
  - `rg -n \"\\(ui-design-system.md\\)|\\(ui-layout-requirements.md\\)|\\(governance/development-governance-handbook.md\\)|\\(guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md\\)\" docs/INDEX.md`
- Confirm cross-links already exist:
  - Root README points to index: `rg -n \"\\[Repository Index & Map\\]\\(docs/INDEX.md\\)\" README.md`
  - Docs index points back: `rg -n \"\\[Repository Index & Map\\]\\(INDEX.md\\)\" docs/README.md`

**Notes / Residual Risks**
- The index intentionally focuses on high-traffic directories to keep the diff small; it’s easy to extend later if needed.
