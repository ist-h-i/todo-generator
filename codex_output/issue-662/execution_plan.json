    "notes": "Keep the route lean: confirm the custom single-select already closes on option click with proper focus/keyboard/outside-click behavior. If confirmed, publish a brief release summary and close. If a mismatch is found, we will add coder and implementation_reviewer in a follow-up to implement a localized option-click handler (select → closePanel(true) → focus restore).",
    "tests": "Manual: (1) Open single-select → click an option → panel closes, focus returns to trigger. (2) Arrow keys to option + Enter → selection and close. (3) ESC → closes; outside click → closes without forced focus. (4) Multi-select/native <select> unchanged. (5) Click a disabled option → no selection change; panel stays open."
