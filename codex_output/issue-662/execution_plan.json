    "tests": "Manual checks: (1) Open → click option → value updates, panel closes, focus returns to trigger. (2) Arrow keys + Enter → selection and close. (3) ESC closes without selection change. (4) Click outside closes without forcing focus. (5) Disabled option click does nothing and panel stays open. (6) Multi-select/native select paths remain unchanged."
