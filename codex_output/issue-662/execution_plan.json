    "notes": "Keep scope minimal: confirm the custom single-select already closes on option click with correct focus and keyboard/ESC/outside-click behaviors. If confirmed, close with a brief release summary. If not, add coder+implementation_reviewer in a follow-up to implement a localized option-click handler that selects then closePanel(restoreFocus). Watch for path mismatch and disabled-option behavior.",
    "tests": "Manual: (1) Open single-select → click an option → panel closes, value updates, focus returns to trigger. (2) Arrow keys to an option + Enter → selection and close. (3) Press ESC while open → closes. (4) Click outside → closes without forced focus. (5) Multi-select/native <select> paths remain unchanged. (6) Try clicking a disabled option → selection should not change and panel should not close."
