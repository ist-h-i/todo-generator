    "notes": "Verify the custom single-select already closes on option click, restores focus, and preserves keyboard/ESC/outside-click behaviors. If confirmed, close as already compliant with a concise release note; if not, we will add coder + implementation_reviewer in a follow-up. Watch for path mismatch; confirm the actual component location in this repo snapshot.",
    "tests": "Manual: (1) Open selector, click an option -> panel closes, value updates, focus returns to trigger. (2) ArrowDown + Enter -> selection and close. (3) ESC closes; outside click closes without forced focus. (4) Confirm multi-select/native select paths unchanged. Document findings in the review step."
