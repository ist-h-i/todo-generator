    "notes": "Confirm in-repo that the custom single-select already closes on option click and restores trigger focus; Enter/ESC/outside-click behaviors unchanged. If confirmed, ship a release note with residual risks. If a mismatch is found, spin a follow-up with a minimal coder+implementation_reviewer pass focused on the option click handler.",
    "tests": "Manual checks: (1) Open single-select → click option → value updates, panel closes, focus returns to trigger. (2) Arrow keys to option + Enter → selection and close. (3) ESC → closes; selection unchanged. (4) Click outside → closes without forcing focus. (5) Click disabled option → no selection change; panel stays open. Multi-select/native select remain unchanged."
