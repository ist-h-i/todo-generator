**Security Review**

- The change is a local UI layout update in an Angular template (Tailwind classes). No new data flows, APIs, or dependencies introduced.

**Input Validation & XSS**
- Angular interpolation `{{ ... }}` escapes HTML by default; displaying `subtask.title` and `column.title` remains safe from XSS unless `[innerHTML]` or bypass sanitization is used elsewhere.
- Risk: If any subtask/column text contains malicious HTML and is later rendered via `[innerHTML]`, it could become exploitable. Current diff shows only interpolation.
- Recommendation: Confirm this component and related board templates avoid `[innerHTML]` for these fields. If present, use Angularâ€™s `DomSanitizer` carefully and prefer plain interpolation.

**Data Exposure & Privacy**
- Vertical stacking can increase visible space, potentially revealing more text if truncation was relied on visually.
- Recommendation: Ensure existing truncation/wrapping classes (e.g., `truncate`, `line-clamp-*`, `break-words`) remain on the content element so no additional sensitive task text is exposed unintentionally.
- Avoid adding data attributes with sensitive content. None added in this change.

**Secrets & Configuration**
- No secrets, tokens, or configuration paths touched. No new logging introduced.
- Recommendation: No action needed; ensure screenshots/redacted data in PR do not include real task content.

**Dependencies & Build**
- No new packages or version bumps. No supply-chain changes or new postinstall scripts.
- Recommendation: None.

**A11y & UX-Security Considerations**
- DOM order updated to status-first, which aligns visual and reading order; improves predictability for screen readers and keyboard users.
- Recommendation: If any ARIA relationships exist, verify they still reference the correct elements after reorder.

**Residual Risks**
- If other parts of the app rely on fixed heights/virtualization, taller cards could alter user perception or introduce layout jank (not a security issue, but can affect usability).
- If older Safari is in scope and `gap` is unsupported, spacing changes could reduce readability (again, usability).

**Actionable Recommendations**
- Verify no `[innerHTML]` usage for `subtask.title`/`column.title` in board-related templates; if found, replace with interpolation or sanitize appropriately.
- Confirm content truncation/wrapping classes are preserved on the content node to avoid unintended data exposure.
- Run a quick a11y check (axe) on the board view to ensure no new violations and correct reading order.
- Keep PR screenshots anonymized; avoid real data.
