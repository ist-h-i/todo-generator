    "notes": "Lean route focused on clarifying scope, defining a reusable selector spec, implementing a shared component/style, and validating UI/UX and accessibility. Skips heavy process (design_reviewer, performance, security, release) to minimize churn while meeting visual and a11y constraints.",
    "tests": "1) Visual parity: side-by-side compare with reference selectors; check colors, spacing, radius, typography, icons. 2) Interaction states: hover/focus/active/disabled/error/loading on both light/dark if applicable. 3) Keyboard: Tab/Shift+Tab focus order; Arrow keys navigation; Enter/Escape behavior; clearable action focusability. 4) Accessibility: label association, ARIA roles/attributes, focus outline visibility, announcements; contrast >= WCAG AA. 5) Functional: selection changes propagate; placeholders and helper/error text positions match; no console errors. 6) Regression: confirm reference selectors unchanged in appearance and behavior."
