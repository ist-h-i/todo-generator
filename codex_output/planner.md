**Repo Findings**
- Framework: Angular with standalone components, not React (frontend/angular.json, .ts templates).
- Tooling: TypeScript and Tailwind are already configured (frontend/tsconfig.json, frontend/tailwind.config.js).
- Aliases: Uses `@app`, `@core`, `@features`, `@lib`, `@shared` (no `@` → `src`).
- Styles: Global SCSS imports include `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss` which defines modern select styling.
- Current selects: Widely used as native `<select class="form-control app-select">...` across features; the new CSS centers the caret and increases right padding.

**Impact Analysis**
- Integrating the provided React shadcn+Radix Select is not appropriate here (Angular app; Radix is React-only; no `/components/ui`).
- The requirement “trigger icon vertically centered and modern” is already implemented via CSS in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss`:
  - Uses background chevrons with `background-position: right <space> center` for vertical centering.
  - Provides modern spacing and states (hover/focus/dark).
- Minimal path to completion is to standardize usage: keep native select and ensure `app-select` class is used consistently.

**Component/Path Defaults**
- Angular components live under `frontend/src/app/...`.
- Global styles live under `frontend/src/styles.scss` and `frontend/src/styles/pages/*`.
- There is no `/components/ui` convention in this Angular codebase; creating it for React components would add complexity and be unused.

**Decision**
- Do not attempt to add React/shadcn structure or Radix dependencies.
- Finalize and document the Angular-native select styling already present.
- Ensure templates consistently include `app-select` with `form-control`.

**Minimal Plan**
- Verify/normalize select usage to `class="form-control app-select"` in templates where missing.
- Keep the new CSS as the system-wide default; no external packages required.
- Add a concise usage note for contributors (where to apply `app-select`).
- Build to validate no style regressions.

**Risks**
- Any non-standard select usage without `app-select` will not get the new style; we will scan and update only where necessary to minimize scope.
- Tailwind tokens differ from shadcn; our CSS uses existing design tokens in `styles.scss`, avoiding conflicts.

**Open Questions**
- Do we need to support multi-selects with the same visual treatment beyond the disabled background chevrons? (CSS currently disables chevrons for `multiple`/`size`.)
- Any pages using custom select widgets that should be aligned to this style?
- Is the current chevron color/size acceptable, or should we adjust contrast for dark mode?
