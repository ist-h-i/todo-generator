Here’s a minimal, execution-ready plan to lift the per-item limit for Profile “Business” and “Role content” fields from 32 to 200 characters across all layers with the least necessary change.

**Scope**
- Update only the two profile fields (“業務” and “ロールの内容”) length limits from 32 → 200 at UI, API/validators, domain rules, and DB schema.
- Keep validation semantics the same except for the new max-length and message.
- Use a widening DB migration with no data rewrite.

**Plan**
- Locate all constraints: constants, validators, DTO/schema, entity/ORM column types, migrations, and i18n messages tied to 32.
- Database: add a migration to widen affected columns to length 200 (e.g., VARCHAR(200)) without altering nullability/indexes unless required.
- Backend: bump max length checks to 200 in request DTOs/validators and any domain/service rules; update error messages (JA) to reflect 200.
- Frontend (Angular): set `maxlength="200"` (and Angular validators) on the relevant inputs; update localized helper/error text to 200; ensure any char counters use 200.
- Tests: update existing 32-length tests; add boundary tests for 200/201; include API and UI validations.
- Deploy in safe order: run DB migration first; then deploy API; then deploy SPA.

**Residual Risks / Open Questions**
- Unknown exact model/column names and whether these fields are indexed; if indexed in MySQL with utf8mb4, index length limits may need handling (prefix index or drop/recreate as needed).
- Counting semantics: current validators may count UTF-16 code units, not grapheme clusters; maintaining existing behavior minimizes scope unless stricter Unicode-grapheme counting is required.
- Localization keys/structure: ensure only the specific message(s) are updated to avoid affecting unrelated copies.

**Validation Tests**
- Server: payload with 200 chars passes; 201 chars fails with updated JA message. Existing 32-char tests updated to 200.
- DB: persisted records with 200-char items read back intact.
- UI: inputs accept up to 200 chars; show correct error at 201; updated helper text visible; no layout breakage in typical views.
- Regression: create/edit flows for profiles with mixed list items still function.
