Plan focus: solve lint failures and keep tests green with minimal, behavior-preserving edits. Backend uses Ruff; frontend uses ESLint + Prettier on Angular 20.

What to change
- Backend: keep the merged f-string and the shared `_PATCH_ATTRIBUTE` sentinel in `backend/app/sqlalchemy_py313_compat.py`.
- Frontend: keep direct updater form `store.update(updater)` in `frontend/src/app/lib/forms/signal-forms.ts`.

Why this is sufficient
- These address the previously flagged lint concerns without altering runtime behavior.
- Tooling is already configured: Ruff (pyproject.toml) and ESLint/Prettier (frontend/.eslintrc.cjs, scripts).

Residual risks / open questions
- CI might enforce formatting gates (Black/Prettier) beyond local checks; run format tasks if needed.
- Node/ChromeHeadless availability for Angular tests in CI; assumed configured.
- If additional, unrelated lint errors appear, limit changes to the smallest local fixes rather than broad refactors.
- Angular Signals API is v20; `store.update(updater)` is compatible.

Validation outline
- Backend: run Ruff and pytest.
- Frontend: run ESLint, unit tests, optional build.
