Proposed route: keep it coder-only. The change is purely documentation (1 new index file + 1â€“2 link insertions). No build or code behavior changes, so adding QA or integration stages offers little value under the 30-minute cap.

What will be done
- Create a concise repository-wide index at docs/INDEX.md mapping top-level areas and key docs.
- Add a single cross-link in README.md to the index.
- Add a single cross-link in docs/README.md to the index.
- Keep all edits minimal and avoid restructuring or renaming.

Residual risks and notes
- Coverage is intentionally shallow to keep the diff minimal; can be extended later.
- Filename choice INDEX.md keeps it predictable; switch to 00-index.md later if ordering is desired.
- English-only for now; bilingual can be added in a follow-up if requested.
