**Findings**
- Backend already includes a security-headers middleware in `backend/app/main.py:156` and a focused test in `backend/tests/test_security_headers.py:1`.
- Documentation updated at `docs/security-review.md` describing changes and residual risks.
- Scope and constraints satisfied with minimal, low-risk changes; no further coding needed.

**Minimal Route**
- Skip coder/integrator; proceed directly to release_manager to publish the summary and close out the cycle.

**Residual Risks**
- HSTS effective only over HTTPS; confirm production TLS.
- Referrer-Policy is strict; analytics depending on referrer may be impacted.
- SPA tokens still in `localStorage`; migration to httpOnly cookies deferred.
- CSP for SPA host deferred to a future, coordinated pass.
