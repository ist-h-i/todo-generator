I reviewed the failing select component and applied a minimal, type-safe fix to unblock CI.

What I changed
- Normalized value handling everywhere we do selection checks to avoid calling includes on a possibly null value.
  - Updated selection predicate to use a safe array for both single and multiple modes:
    - frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:256
- Kept the previous null-safe label derivation intact for the multiple-select label join.

Why this fixes the error
- The prior error came from calling includes on a possibly null value (TS2531). By normalizing to a string array first, includes is always safe, and the logic remains consistent for both single and multi-select.

Key references
- Selection check now uses a normalized array:
  - frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:256
- Multiple mode label derivation already safe:
  - frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:286

Impact
- Behavior unchanged; only safer type handling.
- Styles and the modernized arrow/currentColor alignment remain intact.
- Scope is a single-file, minimal change.

How to verify
- Build: cd frontend && ng build --configuration production
- Tests: cd frontend && npm test (Karma should start with 0 load errors)
- Manual: Confirm selects show correct labels for single/multi, and no console errors. Dark mode arrow remains visible and matches text color.

Note on React/shadcn request
- This repo is Angular. The provided React/shadcn component path (/components/ui) doesnâ€™t apply here. We retained the Angular shared select (frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts) and centralized SCSS updates for minimal impact and full app coverage. If you need a separate React setup, I can provide a shadcn/Tailwind guide and component placement under /components/ui in a React app.
