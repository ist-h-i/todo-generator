**Integration Summary**

- Confirmed stack: Angular + Tailwind + TypeScript (not React/shadcn).
- Modern select styling with a vertically centered, simple chevron is implemented globally via SCSS.
- All known templates use the standardized classes; no additional code changes required.

**What’s In Place**

- Centered trigger icon and modern look:
  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85` — Base rule targets `.app-select, select.form-control`.
  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:94` — Extra right padding so the icon isn’t flush.
  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:113` — `background-position: right … center` for vertical centering.
- Example usage in templates:
  - `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255`
  - `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:274`
  - `frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129`
  - `frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:425`

**Why Not shadcn/React Here**

- The repo is an Angular app; Radix UI Select and shadcn components are React-only.
- Creating `/components/ui` for React and adding `@radix-ui/react-select` would add unused dependencies and increase scope.

**How To Use (Angular)**

- Apply `class="form-control app-select"` to native `<select>` elements for consistent styling and centered icon.
- Multi-select and `size > 1` variants are handled (caret removed, padding adjusted) by the SCSS defaults.

**Project Structure Notes**

- Components live under `frontend/src/app/...`.
- Global/shared styles live under `frontend/src/styles.scss` and `frontend/src/styles/pages/*`.
- There is no `/components/ui` convention in this Angular codebase.

**Risks / Open Questions**

- RTL is not adjusted (icon is anchored to the right). Add logical-position rules if RTL is needed.
- High-contrast/forced-colors mode may need a tweak to ensure caret visibility or fallback to native.

**Optional Next Steps**

- If you want RTL support, I can add `:dir(rtl)` overrides for the caret position.
- If you need React/shadcn in a separate React app, I can provide a minimal setup guide and drop the provided `select.tsx`, `label.tsx`, and `demo.tsx` into `/components/ui` there.
