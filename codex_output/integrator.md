**Integrator Findings**

- All planned changes are already present; no further edits needed.
- Type safety, lint enforcement, and docs align with “no explicit any” and Angular v20 guidance.

**What I Verified**

- Explicit any in TS:
  - Only `writeValue(obj: any)` exists due to ControlValueAccessor: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:205
  - `value` is strongly typed: `string | string[] | null` in the same file.
- Lint enforcement:
  - Global rule enabled: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any: "error"` at frontend/.eslintrc.cjs:30
  - Narrow override only for the CVA file at frontend/.eslintrc.cjs:36
- Strict typing:
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled: frontend/tsconfig.json:6
  - Angular strict template checking enabled: frontend/tsconfig.json:32
- Documentation updated:
  - Angular guidelines: discourages `any`, prefers `unknown`/generics, and warns on `$any(...)` casts (templates).
    - docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md
  - Governance handbook: “No any”, CVA `writeValue(obj: any)` exception via ESLint override, usage examples.
    - docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md:168–179
- Angular v20 alignment:
  - Project uses Angular v20.x packages (CLI/Build/Core/Forms/Router) with strict settings and modern patterns in guidelines (OnPush, signals, Resource API, control flow).

**No Further Changes**

- The single framework-mandated `any` is isolated to the CVA signature with a file-scoped ESLint override.
- TS sources otherwise contain no explicit `any`. Templates contain `$any(...)` casts that are documented as discouraged.

**Residual Risks / Open Questions**

- Numerous `$any(...)` casts remain in templates. Safe replacement requires typing FormControls/event targets per template; propose incremental cleanup.
- Acceptance criteria: If “zero any” includes template `$any`, a follow-up is needed; if limited to TS code, this meets the bar with the CVA exception.
- Coordination with PR #507: Confirm whether to supersede or rebase; current tree already reflects the intended state.

**How To Land Safely**

- Open a short “confirm and document” PR or update PR #507 with a summary that no further code changes were needed and that docs and lint rules are in place.
- Note the CVA exception and the future effort to reduce `$any(...)` in templates.

**Validation Commands**

- Scan for explicit any in TypeScript:
  - rg -n "\bany\b" -S -t ts
- Frontend lint/build/tests:
  - cd frontend && npm run lint
  - cd frontend && npm run build
  - cd frontend && npm test -- --watch=false

If you want, I can scope a minimal follow-up to replace a small set of `$any(...)` casts in one feature template with typed controls.
