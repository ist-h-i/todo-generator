**Integration Outcome**

- A reusable Angular Select UI component is in place and used.
- All selectors render with a modern, centered down chevron and proper spacing.
- No React/shadcn introduced to keep scope minimal and aligned with Angular stack.

**What’s Implemented**

- UI component: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:14`
  - Standalone Angular component (ControlValueAccessor) wrapping native `select`.
  - Applies `class="form-control app-select"` so it inherits global styling.
  - Supports `formControlName`, `disabled`, `multiple`, and `size`.

- Applied in app:
  - Reports: `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.ts:34`, `frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255`
  - Admin: `frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.ts:52`, `frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129,423`

- Global select styling (simple down arrow, vertically centered):
  - `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85`
  - Key bits: inline SVG chevron, `background-position: right 1.6rem center`, comfortable right padding.

**Coverage**

- New component drives several key forms (Reports, Admin).
- Remaining native selects already use `app-select` and match the new design:
  - Settings: `frontend/src/app/features/settings/page.html:247,426`
  - Analyze: `frontend/src/app/features/analyze/page.html:262`
  - Board: `frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:564,729`

**Default Paths**

- Components: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui`
- Styles: `frontend/src/styles.scss`, `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss`

**Why Not /components/ui (shadcn)**

- This repo is Angular (not React). Creating `/components/ui` and adding React/shadcn files would not compile and adds unnecessary complexity. Keeping UI parts under `shared/ui` fits the existing architecture and minimizes impact.

**Dependencies**

- No new NPM packages installed. React/Radix not applicable in Angular.
- Tailwind and TypeScript are already configured (see `frontend/tailwind.config.js`, `frontend/tsconfig*.json`).

**Notes & Optional Follow‑ups**

- You can gradually replace remaining native `<select>` with `<app-ui-select>` for full uniformity; visuals are already consistent due to global CSS.
- If multi-select usage expands, consider enhancing `UiSelectComponent` to sync array values into projected `<option selected>` states.

**If React/shadcn Is Required Elsewhere**

- Only in a React app. Then standardize components under `/components/ui`, add `select.tsx`, `label.tsx`, and a `cn` utility, and install `@radix-ui/react-select` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`. Not recommended in this Angular repo.
