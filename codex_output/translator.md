**Restated Request**
- Fix lint errors and adjust code so all tests pass.
- Keep changes minimal, behavior-preserving, and self-contained.
- Prioritize readability/consistency; respect repoâ€™s split between general and Angular-specific guidelines.

**Assumptions**
- Both backend and Angular frontend exist and have linters/tests configured.
- No new dependencies or tooling changes are allowed.
- Prior minimal refactors (string formatting and signal update) are acceptable and behavior-neutral.
- Environment has workspace write access; network access is restricted.

**Constraints**
- Minimal-diff changes; avoid creating new tasks or scope creep.
- Deliver a finished, shippable outcome within a short time window (~30 minutes).
- Follow Development Governance Handbook and Angular Coding & Design Guidelines where applicable.
- Approval policy is non-interactive; proceed without waiting for confirmations.

**Unknowns**
- Exact linting toolchains and configurations (e.g., flake8/ruff/black for backend; ESLint/TSLint/Prettier for frontend).
- Current failing lint rules and failing test suites.
- CI expectations (required scripts, coverage thresholds, formatting gates).
- Whether the repo contains alluded backend/frontend paths or is partially docs-only.

**Clarifying Questions**
- Which linters and test commands are authoritative for backend and frontend?
- Are there known failing rules/tests to target first?
- Should we confine changes strictly to formatting/typing and trivial refactors (no logic changes)?
- Any directories to exclude from this pass (e.g., generated, legacy, or archived code)?
