**Summary Of Request**
- Create a concise, repository-wide index that explains where key code and documents live so newcomers can quickly find and understand what they need.
- Keep changes minimal and low-risk; avoid restructures and large rewrites.
- Refresh and align README/docs where necessary to improve navigation, focusing on accuracy and readability.

**Intended Deliverables**
- A single index document mapping top-level areas (code, docs, scripts, configs, CI) with brief descriptions and links (e.g., `docs/INDEX.md`).
- Lightweight cross-links from `README.md` and `docs/README.md` to the new index.
- Ensure “Quick Links” remain accurate: `docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md`, `docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md`, `docs/ui-design-system.md`, `docs/ui-layout-requirements.md`.

**Non-Goals**
- No structural changes (no renames/moves/splits).
- No broad content rewrites across the repo.
- No dependency/tooling modifications.

**Assumptions**
- English documentation is acceptable.
- Existing link structure should be preserved; minimal diff is preferred.
- The repo already contains the key documents listed under Quick Links.

**Constraints**
- Minimize scope and risk; keep edits tightly targeted.
- Fit within a 30-minute execution window.
- Network access is restricted; rely only on in-repo content.
- Avoid introducing broken links or altering existing anchors.

**Unknowns**
- Exact top-level directory layout (frontend/backend/monorepo/packages/infra).
- Preferred index filename (`docs/INDEX.md` vs `docs/00-index.md` for ordering).
- Desired coverage of CI/infra (e.g., `.github/workflows`, Docker).
- Whether bilingual (JP/EN) headings are desired.

**Risks**
- Incomplete coverage if the repo has many feature-specific subfolders.
- Future directory changes may require index updates.

**Clarifying Questions**
- Which top-level areas are must-have in the first pass (frontend, backend, infra/CI, scripts)?
- Do you prefer `docs/INDEX.md` or `docs/00-index.md` for prominence?
- Should the index include CI/Docker/deployment pointers?
- Do you want bilingual headings/descriptions (JP/EN) or English-only for now?
- Any additional must-link docs beyond the four Quick Links (e.g., contributing, ADRs, recipes)?
