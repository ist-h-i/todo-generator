## Restated Request (English)
- Replace the “5 Whys” analysis with an Immunity Map structure.
- Introduce and visualize the Immunity Map as a Mermaid flow diagram that can be viewed in Mermaid Live Editor.
- Build a retrospective diagram with three levels:
  - Level 1 (A): “Things to do,” “Things I can’t do,” “Things I want to do.”
  - Level 2: 
    - B: Inhibitors (draw lines from A to B)
    - C: Shadow goals / ideal self / goals (draw lines from A to C)
  - Level 3:
    - D: Deep psychology/bias causing inhibitors (draw lines from B to D)
    - E: True needs (draw lines from B and C to E)
    - F: Fundamental fixed concepts (draw lines from C to F)
- Hide any nodes and edges that have no content (do not render empty items).

## Assumptions
- The output is a single Mermaid flowchart snippet that renders correctly in Mermaid Live Editor.
- Mermaid “flowchart” syntax with subgraphs will be used to represent Levels 1–3.
- Letters A–F are structural categories; actual node labels will be user-provided content.
- Edges follow: A→B, A→C, B→D, B→E, C→E, C→F.
- This change is documentation-only (no app or build changes).

## Constraints
- Keep edits minimal and tightly scoped; prefer a single new/updated doc with Mermaid content.
- Fit in a 30-minute window; smallest viable diff.
- Deliver a finished, self-contained snippet that requires no extra tooling.

## Unknowns
- Exact content for each category (A–F) and how many items per category.
- Whether to keep A–F letters visible in labels or only use descriptive text.
- Desired diagram direction (e.g., `flowchart TD` vs `LR`) and styling (colors, classes).
- Target repository path/filename for the diagram (e.g., `docs/analysis/immune-map.md`).
- Whether to remove or deprecate any existing “5 Whys” docs.

## Clarifying Questions
- Do you want the letters A–F shown in node labels, or only descriptive text?
- Which flow direction do you prefer: top-to-down (`TD`) or left-to-right (`LR`)?
- Do you want level grouping via Mermaid subgraphs labeled “Level 1/2/3”?
- Where should this live in the repo (proposed: `docs/analysis/immune-map.md`)?
- Should we deprecate or remove any existing 5 Whys documentation, and if so, where is it?
- Any preferred styling (colors, classes) or is default Mermaid styling fine?
- Will you provide the actual content for each node now, or should we deliver a blank template that omits empty nodes by default?
