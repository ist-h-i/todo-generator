**Request Summary**
- Redesign the app-wide “selector” (dropdown/select input) to a modern style.
- Fix spacing: the “open” button/caret is flush to the edge; add sufficient padding.
- Apply consistently across the app with minimal, targeted changes.

**Assumptions**
- “Selector” refers to dropdown inputs (native `<select>`, a shared custom component, or Angular Material `mat-select`).
- Styling-only change; no behavior, API, or layout restructuring.
- Centralized styling exists (design tokens/SCSS variables) and should be used.
- Accessibility and keyboard/focus states must be preserved or improved.
- Dark mode/theme support must remain consistent if present.

**Constraints**
- Minimize scope and risk; prefer overriding shared component/theme styles.
- Avoid breaking changes to component APIs or templates.
- Keep within existing design system tokens (colors, spacing, radius, typography).
- Maintain cross-browser support and responsive behavior.

**Unknowns**
- Which selector implementations are in use (native, custom, Angular Material)?
- Exact design direction for “modern” (radius, shadow, borders, density).
- Target padding values around the caret/open button.
- Required states (hover, focus, active, disabled, error) visual specs.
- Theming requirements (light/dark), RTL support, and target browsers.

**Clarifying Questions**
- Which component(s) power selectors: native `<select>`, custom, `mat-select`, or mixed?
- Do we have design tokens/specs for “modern” (radius, spacing, colors, focus ring)?
- What padding should surround the caret/open button (e.g., 8–12px)?
- Any size/density standard (e.g., 40–44px min touch target, 36/40/48px heights)?
- Which states must be designed (default/hover/focus/disabled/error) and do we have examples?
- Should we animate open/close or caret rotation? Any motion constraints?
- Must this change apply app-wide automatically via theme overrides, or only to specific modules?
- Are there screenshots or examples of the “broken” layout to confirm issues and scope?
- What are the supported browsers and themes (light/dark, RTL)?
- Are there existing regressions tests or visual baselines we must preserve?

**Residual Risks**
- Global CSS/theme overrides may cause regressions in edge cases.
- Mixed selector implementations may require multiple targeted overrides.
- Without precise design specs, “modern” could be interpreted inconsistently.
