**English Restatement**

- Issue Title: Periodic Refactoring
- Issue Body: Perform a comprehensive refactor of the codebase.

**Assumptions**

- “Comprehensive” should be interpreted pragmatically to fit a small, low‑risk diff and 30‑minute task windows.
- Primary goals are readability, maintainability, and consistency without changing behavior.
- Repository separates language‑agnostic standards from Angular‑specific rules; both apply where relevant.
- No external network access; actions should not require new dependencies.
- Workspace write is allowed; avoid large-scale restructuring.

**Constraints**

- Minimize scope and impact; smallest viable diff.
- Finish with a self-contained, shippable outcome.
- Each task must fit within 30 minutes.
- Follow repository guidelines (Development Governance Handbook; Angular Coding & Design Guidelines where applicable).
- Approval policy: never; proceed without interactive approvals.

**Unknowns**

- Actual tech stack present (docs-only vs. codebase; presence of Angular SPA).
- Current pain points or targets for refactor (e.g., duplication, lint issues).
- Existing test coverage and CI gates.
- Definition of “comprehensive” vs. incremental within this repo’s context.
- Priority areas (performance, readability, architecture, dead code).

**Risks**

- Over‑refactoring causing unintended behavior changes if code exists.
- Scope creep from “comprehensive” expectation conflicting with minimal-diff constraint.
- Inconsistent application of mixed guidelines if the repo has multiple technologies.

**Clarifying Questions**

- Does this repository contain executable code or primarily documentation/guidelines?
- If code exists, which areas/modules are highest priority for refactoring?
- Are there existing linters/formatters or quality gates to align with?
- Should refactoring be limited to non-functional changes (naming, structure, dead code removal) only?
- Is there an Angular SPA in this repo, and if so, which directories are in scope?
- Do we have any known issues (bugs, smells, duplications) to target first?
