**Summary**
- Update and improve the root `README` and Markdown files under `docs/`, applying additions, edits, deletions, merges, splits, and renames as appropriate to bring documentation up to date, with minimal, targeted changes.

**Assumptions**
- A `README` exists at the repo root and a `docs/` directory contains Markdown files.
- The update focuses on content accuracy, structure, and clarity rather than large-scale reorganization.
- Existing repository conventions (e.g., Development Governance Handbook, Angular guidelines) should guide terminology and structure if applicable.
- English is acceptable for documentation updates unless otherwise specified.

**Constraints**
- Minimize scope and impact; smallest viable diff.
- Complete within a ~30-minute execution window.
- Produce a finished, self-contained result without creating unnecessary tasks.
- No network access; rely on in-repo sources only.

**Unknowns**
- Specific pain points or outdated sections in current docs.
- Priority areas (e.g., setup instructions, contribution workflow, UI guidelines).
- Target audience and language preference (English/Japanese/bilingual).
- Acceptance criteria (e.g., style guide, tone, required sections).
- Whether major renames or restructuring are desired or only incremental fixes.

**Clarifying Questions**
- Which documents are highest priority to fix first (README vs specific `docs/` files)?
- Are there mandatory sections (e.g., Quick Start, Contribution Guide, Release Process) that must be present?
- Preferred language(s) for the final docs (English, Japanese, or both)?
- Are there repository-specific style or formatting rules beyond general Markdown conventions?
- Any known inaccuracies or deprecated content to remove?
- Should we align docs explicitly with the cited handbooks/guidelines (and which versions)?

**Residual Risks**
- Over- or under-scoping without clear priorities could miss expectations.
- Structural changes (renames/splits) may break inbound links if not coordinated.
- Bilingual requirements could exceed the minimal-change constraint without guidance.
