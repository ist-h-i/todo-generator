**Summary Of Request**
- Periodically refresh and improve documentation with minimal changes, prioritizing readability and navigation.
- Add a concise, repository-wide index that explains where key code/docs live so newcomers can quickly find what they need.
- Keep edits low-risk: avoid restructures, focus on `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, and a new `docs/INDEX.md`.

**Intended Deliverables**
- `docs/INDEX.md`: top-level directory map (code, docs, scripts, CI/config) with short descriptions and links.
- Cross-links: add “Repository Index & Map” in `README.md` and `docs/README.md` pointing to `docs/INDEX.md` (or `INDEX.md` within docs).
- Validate and preserve Quick Links:
  - `docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md`
  - `docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md`
  - `docs/ui-design-system.md`
  - `docs/ui-layout-requirements.md`

**Non-Goals**
- No renames/moves/splits of files or directories.
- No dependency/tooling changes.
- No broad rewrites outside the minimal navigation improvements.

**Constraints**
- Minimize scope and impact; smallest viable diff.
- Deliver a finished, self-contained outcome.
- 30-minute execution budget.
- Network access restricted; rely only on in-repo content.
- English-only unless requested otherwise.

**Assumptions**
- The four Quick Links exist and should remain canonical entry points.
- English documentation is acceptable for this pass.
- The repository structure will not be changed to accommodate the index.

**Risks**
- Index could become stale as directories evolve.
- Potential for broken links if paths are inferred incorrectly.
- Overfitting the index to current patterns (e.g., routing search tips) may require updates later.

**Unknowns**
- Exact top-level layout (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`, `packages/`, `infra/`).
- Preference for index filename prominence (`docs/INDEX.md` vs `docs/00-index.md`).
- Whether to include CI/Docker/deployment pointers.
- Desire for bilingual (JP/EN) headings or English-only.
- Additional must-link docs beyond the four Quick Links (e.g., CONTRIBUTING, ADRs, recipes).

**Clarifying Questions**
- Which top-level areas are must-include in the first index (frontend, backend, infra/CI, scripts)?
- Do you prefer `docs/INDEX.md` or `docs/00-index.md` for prominence in file listings?
- Should the index cover CI/Docker/deployment (e.g., `.github/workflows/`, Dockerfiles)?
- English-only or JP/EN headings?
- Any additional must-link documents (CONTRIBUTING, ADRs, recipes index)?
