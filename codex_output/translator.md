**Summary Of Request**
- Create a concise, repository-wide index that explains where things live and what they do, so newcomers can quickly find and understand relevant code and docs.
- Keep scope minimal and risk low (small diff, avoid restructures), and deliver a finished, self-contained update.

**Intended Outcomes**
- A single index document mapping code, docs, build, configs, and workflows, with brief descriptions and links.
- Clear pointers to the most important guides:
  - `docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md`
  - `docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md`
  - `docs/ui-design-system.md`
  - `docs/ui-layout-requirements.md`
- New contributors can navigate to key entry points without guesswork.

**Non-Goals**
- No large-scale reorganization, renames, or moving files.
- No content rewrites across all docs; only light cross-linking where necessary.
- No dependency or tooling changes.

**Assumptions**
- English documentation is acceptable (issue is JP, repo guidance indicates English is fine).
- The repo has meaningful top-level directories to index (e.g., `frontend/`, `docs/`, scripts, configs).
- Minimal diffs are required; stability of existing links is a priority.
- Previous minor README/docs tweaks exist and should be preserved.

**Constraints**
- Minimal impact; avoid breaking links and existing anchors.
- 30-minute execution budget; prioritize the highest-value, smallest change.
- Network access is restricted; rely only on repository contents.
- Filesystem is workspace-write; no destructive operations.

**Proposed Scope (Minimal, Safe)**
- Add `docs/INDEX.md` (or `docs/00-index.md` if alphabetical prominence is needed) with:
  - Top-level directory map and brief descriptions.
  - Pointers to Quick Links and other key docs.
  - How to find common code (routing, components, state, services), configs, scripts, CI.
- Add a prominent link from `README.md` to the index.
- Optionally add a link from `docs/README.md` to the index for symmetry.
- No renames; no structural moves.

**Deliverables**
- New `docs/INDEX.md` containing:
  - Overview and navigation tips.
  - Directory-by-directory bullets with short descriptions.
  - Cross-links to governance, Angular guidelines, UI docs, and any “recipes” or automation guides if present.
- Updated `README.md` with a single link to `docs/INDEX.md`.
- Optionally updated `docs/README.md` with a single link to `docs/INDEX.md`.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- A newcomer can locate key code areas and docs in under 2–3 clicks from the root README.
- All links in the new index resolve to existing in-repo files/directories.
- Diff limited to 1 new file and 1–2 small README link insertions.
- No broken existing anchors or removed content.

**Unknowns**
- Exact code layout (e.g., whether there is a `frontend/`, `backend/`, monorepo packages, infra).
- Whether to include infra/CI details (e.g., `.github/workflows`, Dockerfiles) in the first pass.
- Preferred filename for the index (`INDEX.md` vs `00-index.md`).
- Whether bilingual (JP/EN) presentation is desired for the index.

**Risks & Mitigations**
- Risk: Incomplete coverage of all directories → Mitigation: Focus on top-level/high-traffic areas; note how to extend later.
- Risk: Link drift if structure changes later → Mitigation: Keep index light and directory-focused rather than deep-file-specific.
- Risk: Over-scoping → Mitigation: Limit to 1 new file + 1–2 link additions.

**Clarifying Questions**
- Which top-level areas must be covered in the first pass (e.g., frontend, backend, infra, CI)?
- Do you prefer the index filename `docs/INDEX.md` or `docs/00-index.md`?
- Should we include CI, Docker, and deployment pointers in the index?
- Is English-only acceptable, or do you want bilingual headings/descriptions?
- Any must-link documents beyond the Quick Links (e.g., contributing guidelines, code owners, ADRs, recipes)?
