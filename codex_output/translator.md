**Clarified Request**
- Increase the maximum length for Profile “Business/Role content” fields from 32 to 200 characters across all layers (UI validation/messages, API/validators, domain/service rules, and database schema/constraints). Ensure create/edit flows accept and persist up to 200 characters per item, and update the error message accordingly.

**Assumptions**
- Current limit is enforced at multiple layers and the DB column(s) are `VARCHAR(32)` (or equivalent).
- “業務” (business/duty) and “ロールの内容” (role content) are distinct fields or list items; each item should allow up to 200 characters.
- The limit is per item and inclusive (≤ 200).
- Count is by Unicode characters, not bytes.
- Frontend is Angular; backend and DB are relational but unspecified.
- No other profile fields need changes.

**Constraints**
- Minimize scope and avoid unrelated refactors.
- Perform a safe DB migration (expand length only) without data loss.
- Keep i18n/localized validation messages consistent and updated.
- Update only targeted validations and tests.

**Unknowns**
- Exact model/entity names and DB column names for the affected fields.
- Backend framework, validation library, and migration tooling (e.g., NestJS + class-validator, TypeORM/Prisma/etc.).
- Database type (PostgreSQL/MySQL/other) and any length-dependent indexes/constraints.
- UI behavior for longer strings (wrapping/truncation, counters).
- Specific localization requirements for updated error text.

**Clarifying questions**
- Which exact fields/columns map to “業務” and “ロールの内容”? Are these arrays/list items?
- What DB and migration tool are used (TypeORM, Prisma, Sequelize, Flyway, etc.)?
- Should the limit be strictly 200 Unicode characters (grapheme-aware) on both client and server?
- What is the desired updated error message text (Japanese copy) and should a character counter be shown?
- Are there downstream consumers (search, exports, reports) that depend on the 32-char limit and must be updated too?
