**Verdict**

- Requirements are nearly implementable; a few small clarifications will ensure isolation and accessibility compliance.

**Consistency Check**

- Functional, non-functional, and acceptance criteria align: vertical stack at all breakpoints, layout-only change, isolated to subtask card.
- Tailwind utility change is consistent with “minimal impact” and “no global changes”.

**Gaps / Ambiguities**

- Component scope unknown: exact template file for the subtask card on the board view is not specified.
- DOM order vs. accessibility: If content currently precedes status in the DOM, using only CSS order utilities keeps keyboard/AT order as content-first, which conflicts with “status on top” if that is meant visually and semantically.
- Reuse risk: The class string `flex items-start justify-between gap-2` may appear elsewhere; changes must target only the subtask card container.

**Clarifications Needed**

- Confirm the path(s) of the subtask card component/template used in the board view.
- What is the current DOM order of the two elements (status vs. content)? Do we want status first in DOM as well as visually to preserve keyboard/AT reading order?
- Keep `gap-2` as-is, or adjust spacing?

**Implementation Notes (Minimal Change)**

- In the subtask card container only, change `flex items-start justify-between gap-2` to `flex flex-col items-start gap-2`.
- Remove `justify-between` (not meaningful in column direction).
- Ensure the DOM places the status element before content to maintain visual and accessible reading order; avoid relying on `order-*` if accessibility is a priority.
- Do not modify shared/global styles; do not change any other containers that may reuse similar classes.

**Acceptance Criteria Adjustments (Optional Precision)**

- Explicitly state: “Status appears before content in the DOM to preserve keyboard and screen-reader order.”

**Risks & Mitigations**

- Risk: Unintended global impact if class is shared.
  - Mitigation: Limit changes to the specific subtask card template.
- Risk: Accessibility mismatch if visual and DOM orders differ.
  - Mitigation: Reorder DOM elements so status precedes content.

**Ready-to-Implement Summary**

- Target the subtask card container in the board view template.
- Replace `flex items-start justify-between gap-2` with `flex flex-col items-start gap-2`.
- Ensure status markup appears before content in the DOM.
- No other layout, data, or responsive changes.
