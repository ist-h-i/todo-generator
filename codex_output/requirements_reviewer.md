**Review Summary**
- The requirement is clear: stack “Status” above “Content” within the subtask card container currently using `flex items-start justify-between gap-2`.
- Scope is constrained to Board view subtask cards; minimal change approach via Tailwind utilities is appropriate.
- A few specifics remain ambiguous (target component, responsive behavior, exact spacing/alignment), but can be resolved with explicit defaults.

**Consistency Check**
- No contradictions with the goal of minimal-impact changes.
- FRs, NFRs, and ACs are aligned; however, retaining `gap-2` while removing `justify-between` should explicitly confirm using `flex-col` + `gap-2` + `items-start` + `justify-start`.

**Gaps / Ambiguities**
- Target location: exact component/template file(s) for Board subtask cards are unspecified.
- Responsiveness: unclear if vertical stack applies universally or only below certain breakpoints.
- Spacing/alignment: whether to keep `gap-2` and swap `justify-between` for `justify-start` is implied but not stated.
- Reuse risk: whether the class string is shared by non-subtask elements in Board is unknown.

**Proposed Defaults to Close Gaps**
- Target: Only the subtask card container in the Board view component/template.
- Breakpoints: Apply vertical stack at all breakpoints (no responsive overrides).
- Classes: Replace `flex items-start justify-between gap-2` with `flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-2`.
- Order: Ensure DOM order is Status first, then Content to align with visual order and a11y.
- Scope guard: If the class string is reused elsewhere, scope the change to the subtask card selector/component only.

**Edge Cases**
- Long titles/descriptions should wrap without overflow; check multi-line status controls don’t collapse spacing.
- A11y: Tab/reading order must match visual order (Status precedes Content).
- RTL layouts (if supported) should be unaffected by vertical stacking.

**Testability / Acceptance Checks**
- On the Board view, each subtask card shows Status above Content with compact vertical spacing matching `gap-2`.
- Confirm container classes reflect `flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-2`.
- Verify no unintended changes to non-subtask cards or other views.
- Check mobile/tablet/desktop for stable wrapping and no clipping.
- Interactions (status select/badge, content text) continue to function unchanged.

**Reworded Acceptance Criteria (Actionable)**
- Update only the Board subtask card container to `flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-2`.
- Status element appears before Content in the DOM and visually above it.
- Spacing between Status and Content approximates `gap-2`; no `justify-between` used.
- No visual or behavioral regressions outside the targeted container.
- Works at all breakpoints without overflow.

If you confirm these defaults (all-breakpoints, `flex-col`, remove `justify-between`, scope to subtask card), the requirements are complete and ready for planning.
