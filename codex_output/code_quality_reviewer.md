**Summary**
- The fix correctly synchronizes programmatic values into the native select so projected <option> elements are reliably read and the label reflects the selected value.

**Correctness**
- `writeValue` mirrors the control value into the native select and then updates the label: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:240. This resolves the “no options/empty label” perception on init.
- Options are built from projected `<option>` nodes and kept up to date via `MutationObserver`, with label sync after updates: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:216, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:220.
- Selection logic is normalized for both single and multiple; label derives from current options and selected values: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:323.
- Click, keyboard, and change paths maintain internal/native sync and propagate changes to the form control: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:266, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:293, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:362.

**Readability**
- The component maintains a clean separation of concerns: option reading, value/label sync, and UI event handling.
- Public `onTouched` is clearly annotated for template usage; other callbacks are private and typed.
- Template and styles are cohesive; comments succinctly document intent.

**Edge Cases**
- Multiple select: `writeValue` selects matching native options; label shows joined labels: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:247, frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:331.
- No options: active index defaults to 0; guarded usage prevents crashes, though -1 could be a cleaner sentinel (see suggestion).
- Async option population: deferred initial read and observer-based updates handle late-projected options without console errors.

**Usages Checked**
- All current usages correctly project `<option>` children:
  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129
  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:218
  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:231
  - frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:423
  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255
  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:274
- Placeholders are provided where needed; no refactor to a different API is required.

**Risks / Open Questions**
- Inert support on the hidden native select is broadly available, but older browsers may behave inconsistently. If issues arise, consider removing `inert` and rely on `aria-hidden` + styling.
- No support for optgroups or custom templating beyond simple `<option disabled>`; confirm that’s acceptable for all current use cases.
- For values not present in options (e.g., persisted “unknown” model), the label renders empty until the option appears. Current settings often inject an explicit `<option>` for the saved value (admin model picker), which is good.

**Suggestions (Non-blocking)**
- Consider setting `activeIndex` to -1 when `options.length === 0` for semantic clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:347.
- Add `aria-labelledby` on the panel, pointing to the trigger, and optionally `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger when open for slightly improved a11y.
- In `onDocClick`, rename `host` to `target` for clarity: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:355.

Overall, the implementation is correct, minimal, and aligns with existing usage patterns. No further call-site changes are needed.
