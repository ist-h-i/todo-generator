**Summary**
- A reusable Angular Select (CVA) was added and applied to key pages while keeping global select styling modern and consistent.
- Scope is minimal, no new deps, and aligns with the Angular codebase (not React/shadcn).

**What I Checked**
- New component: frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:14
- Reports page integration: frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.ts:34, frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255
- Admin page integration: frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.ts:52, frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129
- Global select styles (simple, centered chevron): frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85

**Findings**
- Component design
  - Implements ControlValueAccessor correctly for single-select: onChange/onTouched/disabled/writeValue are wired; value reflects in the DOM via [value] binding.
  - Exposes useful inputs: id, name, multiple, size; maps through to the native select.
  - OnPush change detection with native events is appropriate.
- Styling
  - Modern, simple down chevron via inline SVG; vertically centered via background-position. frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:113
  - Hover/focus/disabled states preserved; dark theme parity included; multi/size variant hides chevron.
- Adoption
  - Replaced selects on Reports and Admin with <app-ui-select>.
  - Other selects (e.g., Analyze, Board, Settings) remain native but already inherit the new global styling.

**Edge Cases**
- Multiple selection
  - Current template does not reflect externally written multi-select values into selected options (no [selected] mapping on <option> for arrays). writeValue only updates `value` and template binds [value] only for !multiple. This is fine for current usage (single-select), but multi-select would need an enhancement if used.

**Quality Suggestions (Non-blocking)**
- Multi-select sync: If multi-select will be used, update writeValue to set `selected` flags on options when `this.multiple` and value is an array. For projected options, a small ViewChild to the native select and a loop to apply `selected = array.includes(option.value)` is sufficient.
- High contrast mode: Optionally hide the SVG chevron in forced-colors to avoid contrast issues:
  - Add: @media (forced-colors: active) { .app-select, select.form-control { background-image: none; } }
- Consistency: Over time, consider migrating remaining native selects (Analyze, Board, Settings) to <app-ui-select> for uniform form integration, though visuals are already consistent.

**Verdict**
- Approve. The component is correct, minimal, and integrates cleanly where applied. The global CSS already delivers the requested modern, centered chevron across the app. Multi-select behavior is the only noted enhancement if/when needed.
