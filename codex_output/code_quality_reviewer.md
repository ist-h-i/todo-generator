**Summary**

- The repository already enforces “no any” in the frontend and documents the policy. No code or config changes are required.

**What I Checked**

- ESLint rule: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is set to error in `frontend/.eslintrc.cjs` (frontend/.eslintrc.cjs:30).
- Lint script: `npm run lint` runs with `--max-warnings=0` in `frontend/package.json` (frontend/package.json:7).
- TS sources: No occurrences of explicit `any` found in `frontend/src/**` (both `: any`, `<any>`, `as any`).
- Templates: No `$any(...)` usages found in `frontend/src/**`.
- Docs: A “Frontend Type Safety: No any” section exists with rationale, alternatives, DTOs location, exceptions, boundary patterns, and privacy notes (docs/development-rules.md:1).

**Correctness**

- Enforcement is active and will fail CI on any `any` usage due to error severity and zero warnings allowed.
- Scope covers all TS files including specs, which matches the decided policy.
- Documentation aligns with repo conventions and provides practical examples and exception guidance.

**Readability**

- The ESLint config is straightforward and minimal; rules are clear and non-redundant.
- Documentation is concise, contains actionable examples, and references the canonical DTOs directory (`frontend/src/app/shared/models`).

**Complexity / Impact**

- Changes are zero-impact at this point; the codebase passes the rule without refactors.
- The setup keeps CI signal clear without introducing additional tooling or rules.

**Acceptance Criteria Status**

- ESLint configured to error on `any`: satisfied (frontend/.eslintrc.cjs).
- Linting passes baseline: should pass; no `any` in TS sources.
- Docs updated with guidance and exceptions policy: satisfied (docs/development-rules.md).
- New/modified code guardrails: enforced by lint; unsafe boundaries guidance present.
- CI behavior: clear failure on violations via `--max-warnings=0`.

**Recommendations (Optional, Non-blocking)**

- Consider a follow-up ticket to evaluate `@angular-eslint/template/no-any` if template casts become an issue, keeping it out of scope for now.
- Optionally track a later hardening phase (warn level) for rules like `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment` to discourage unsafe cast chains, if needed.
