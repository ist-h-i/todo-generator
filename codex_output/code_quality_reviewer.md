**Summary**
- The vertical stacking change for subtask cards is correctly implemented, scoped, and accessible. No further changes required.

**What I Verified**
- Targeted container updated to vertical layout and DOM order puts status first.
  - File: `frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:261`
  - Current markup:
    - Container: `div.flex.flex-col.items-start.gap-2`
    - Children order: status (`{{ column.title }}`) above content (`{{ subtask.title }}`)
- Removed row-only utility (`justify-between`) and preserved alignment/spacing (`items-start`, `gap-2`).
- The change is localized to subtask cards within the boardâ€™s subtask section; no global/shared components affected.

**Acceptance Criteria Check**
- Vertical stack at all breakpoints: yes (`flex-col`).
- Status on top, content below: yes (DOM and visual order).
- Left alignment and spacing: yes (`items-start`, `gap-2`).
- No unintended layout changes found elsewhere: no other matches for the old class.
- No horizontal layout remains in subtask header: confirmed.

**Accessibility**
- DOM order matches visual order (status precedes content), avoiding `order-*` utilities. Screen reader/keyboard order is preserved.

**Code Quality**
- Readability and utility usage are clear and minimal.
- Existing text-wrapping behavior retained (`min-w-0`, `break-words` on title).
- No increase in component complexity; no new styles or inputs added.

**Minor Nits (Optional)**
- If older Safari flex-gap support is a requirement, consider a tiny local fallback (e.g., `mb-2` on the status span). Otherwise, current approach is fine.
- `min-w-0` is harmless here but primarily useful in horizontal flex; can be kept or removed without functional impact.

**Recommendation**
- Keep as-is. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, and the frontend tests when available to ensure no regressions.
