**Summary**
- The required change (stack Status above Content) is already implemented in the Board subtask card template.

**Verification**
- Container uses vertical layout: `flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-2` at frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:261.
- DOM order aligns with visual order:
  - Status (column title) `span` appears first: frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:262
  - Content (subtask title) `h4` appears second: frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:267
- `justify-between` has been removed; spacing is preserved via `gap-2`.

**Acceptance Check**
- Applies only to subtask cards: frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:249
- Accessibility: Order is Status â†’ Content in DOM.
- Responsiveness: No breakpoints override; flex-col applies universally.
- No regressions to other card parts observed (labels, parent info, drag handle).

**Code Quality**
- Change is minimal and localized.
- Readability is consistent with existing Tailwind utility usage.
- No unnecessary refactors or selector changes.

**Recommendations**
- No further changes needed. Optionally, `justify-start` is redundant in a column layout, but keeping it is harmless and explicit.

**Diff**
- No fix diff required; current code meets the requirements.
