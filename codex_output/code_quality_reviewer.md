**Summary**
Overall implementation is close and follows existing patterns. I found and fixed three concrete issues that would have caused runtime errors or test failures:
- Length mismatch between DB column and UI/server validation for nickname.
- Two backend tests still registering without nickname.
- Frontend test double for `AuthService.register` not matching the updated method signature.

What I verified:
- Backend accepts and persists `nickname` on register and returns it in the profile.
- Startup migration backfills existing users’ nicknames and runs at app boot.
- Frontend registration form includes a “ニックネーム” field, validates client-side, and sends the value.
- Profile update flow also uses the same nickname validation style.

**Fixes Applied**
- Align nickname max length to DB column (64 chars) to avoid DB errors.
  - backend/app/services/profile.py:1 – set max to 64
  - frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.ts:220 – client nickname validation max 64
  - frontend/src/app/core/profile/profile-dialog.ts:360 – profile dialog max 64

- Update missed tests to include nickname on registration:
  - backend/tests/test_admin_users.py:128, 171 – add `nickname: "Second"`

- Fix frontend test double to match new register signature:
  - frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.spec.ts:39 – add `nickname` to `RegisterCall`
  - frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/page.spec.ts:57 – mock `register(email, password, nickname)`

**Correctness & Edge Cases**
- Registration
  - API: `POST /auth/register` expects `{ email, password, nickname }`; missing/empty nickname returns 422 via `normalize_nickname`.
  - Duplicate email yields 400; other validations unchanged.
- Persistence
  - DB column is `VARCHAR(64)` nullable; migration backfills NULL/empty with `user-{id}` ensuring non-empty values post-migration while keeping schema lenient.
- Client/Server Validation
  - Both sides enforce non-empty + max length 64; trimming is consistent.
- Profile Update
  - Uses the same max length (64) and error messaging; consistent with DB.

**Readability & Consistency**
- Reused existing error message patterns (Japanese messages) and validators. The nickname validation logic is concise and co-located with other profile validations.

**Residual Risks / Open Questions**
- Uniqueness: Not enforced; duplicates remain possible.
- DB NOT NULL: Column remains nullable by schema (mitigated by backfill and required registration). If a hard guarantee is desired, consider a follow-up migration to set NOT NULL once backfill is broadly deployed.
- Validation scope: No profanity/character-set rules; acceptable per current scope but may need refinement later.
- SSO/social login: Not evaluated; ensure those flows also supply or prompt for nickname if they hit the same endpoint.
- i18n/accessibility: Registration label does not visually mark “必須”; errors do communicate requirement.

If you want, I can also:
- Add a small server-side min length (e.g., 2) to reduce accidental single-character nicknames.
- Propose a phased plan to enforce DB NOT NULL on `users.nickname` once backfill is safely rolled out.
