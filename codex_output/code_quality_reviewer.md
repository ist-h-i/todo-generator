**Summary**
- The custom Angular `UiSelectComponent` delivers a modern options panel: rounded corners, subtle border, elevated shadow, max-height + scroll, entry animation, clear hover/selected/disabled states, and a simple down chevron trigger.
- Scope stays minimal and centralized (component + existing SCSS). The prior TS2341 error is fixed by making `onTouched` public.

**What Looks Good**
- Trigger: vertically centered simple chevron; spacing balanced; `.ui-select__trigger` suppresses background-image from global select styles.
- Panel: `role="listbox"`, items `role="option"` with `aria-selected`, smooth animation, `z-index: 1000`, dark theme parity, high‑contrast safeguard for the chevron icon.
- Keyboard: ArrowUp/Down navigation, Enter to select, Escape to close; click‑outside to dismiss.
- Minimal impact: native `<select>` retained for multi/size; global `_base.scss` keeps parity for native selects.

**Issues To Address (Small, High-Value)**
- Hidden native select remains focusable in single mode.
  - Impact: Tab order includes an invisible control; screen reader noise and confusing focus.
  - Fix: On the hidden select (`.ui-select__native--hidden`) add `[attr.tabindex]=\"-1\" [attr.aria-hidden]=\"true\" inert`. This keeps it in DOM for option parsing/value sync while removing it from focus and accessibility trees.
- Keyboard polish (optional but low‑effort):
  - Scroll active option into view when opening or moving the active index (e.g., `element.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`).
  - Support Home/End keys to jump to first/last option.
  - Consider `aria-activedescendant` on the trigger and `id` on options to expose the active state to AT.
- Focus styling for options (optional):
  - Add `.ui-select__option:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px; }` for clearer keyboard focus.
- Stacking context (verify):
  - `z-index: 1000` is likely fine; confirm it clears any app toolbars/overlays.

**Security/Perf/Compat**
- No new dependencies. CSS `color-mix()` usage mirrors existing styles; older browsers may lack support (already present elsewhere).
- DOM reads are minimal; event listeners are scoped. No obvious security risks.

**Verdict**
- Approve with one required fix: make the hidden select unfocusable/hidden to AT in single mode.
- Optional niceties: scroll active item into view, Home/End keys, focus-visible outline, and `aria-activedescendant`. These are small and safe enhancements if you want me to add them.
