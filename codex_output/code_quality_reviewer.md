**Summary**
- Stack is Angular + Tailwind + TypeScript; React/shadcn/Radix integration is not applicable.
- Modern select styling with vertically centered trigger icon is implemented via CSS; no new deps needed.

**Reviewed Changes**
- Normalized a remaining select to use modern style:
  - frontend/src/app/features/reports/reports-page.component.html:255
- Global select styling provides the requested design:
  - frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85
    - Uses appearance reset and increased right padding.
    - Centers the caret via background-position “right … center”.
    - Adds hover/focus/disabled, dark-mode variants.

**Verification Notes**
- Most selects already use the standardized classes:
  - Examples using `app-select`: frontend/src/app/features/settings/page.html:426, frontend/src/app/features/analyze/page.html:262, frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:729, frontend/src/app/features/admin/page.html:129, 218, 232.
- CSS targets both `.app-select` and `select.form-control`, so legacy usage remains covered.

**Meets Design Ask**
- Trigger icon vertical centering: done via `background-position: right X center` in `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:85`.
- Simple, modern look: padding, radius, subtle shadows, and focus outline are present.

**Quality Observations**
- Accessibility: clear focus outline and no reliance on custom JS; native select semantics preserved.
- Multi-select handling removes chevrons and adjusts padding as expected.
- Dark mode contrast accounted for with alternate color-mix values.

**Risks / Edge Cases**
- RTL locales: arrows are fixed to “right”; optional enhancement is to add `:dir(rtl)` overrides to mirror positions.
- High-contrast/forced-colors: consider an optional media query to fall back to native arrow for visibility.

**Recommendations (Minimal, Optional)**
- Add a short contributor note: use `class="form-control app-select"` for all `<select>` in templates for consistent styling.
- If RTL is in scope, add logical-position overrides:
  - Example: `:dir(rtl) .app-select { background-position: left 1.85rem center, left 1.35rem center; }`
- If targeting Windows High Contrast, consider `@media (forced-colors: active)` to restore native indicator.

**On React/shadcn Instructions**
- Creating `/components/ui` and adding `@radix-ui/react-select` is not suitable for this Angular codebase and would increase scope unnecessarily. The current CSS solution satisfies the issue requirements with minimal impact.
