**Summary**
- Build error TS2341 is resolved by making `onTouched` public. Verified in the shared select component.
- Selector visuals are modernized: single down chevron, vertically centered, with proper right padding via centralized SCSS.
- React/shadcn Select: provide/setup guidance only (repo is Angular). Minor correctness notes for the pasted code.

**Angular Fix (TS2341)**
- Root cause: Angular templates can only access public members; `(blur)="onTouched()"` referenced a private member.
- Current state: `public onTouched: () => void = () => {};` is defined, so templates can call it.
  - Template reference: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:34`
  - Public member: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:52`
- `registerOnTouched(fn)` correctly assigns to the public field: `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/select/ui-select.ts:60`.
- No other template references to private members found.

**Selector Design (CSS)**
- Global rule applies to both `.app-select` and `select.form-control`: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:78`
- Changes meet the request:
  - Simple single down chevron via inline SVG; inherits `currentColor`: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:101`
  - Vertically centered icon: `background-position: right 1.6rem center;` `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:103`
  - Comfortable right padding to avoid flush caret: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:92`
  - States: hover/focus/disabled and dark theme variants covered: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:111`, `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:122`, `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:136`, `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:153`
  - Multi/size>1 hides caret and resets padding: `frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss:164`
- Note: `color-mix()` is used; ensure target browsers support it or accept graceful degradation.

**React/shadcn Select (Integration Notes)**
- This repo is Angular-only; integrate in a React app when available.
- Components folder: use `components/ui` (shadcn convention). Rationale: shadcn CLI scaffolds and docs assume this path; keeps primitives discoverable.
- Ensure `@/lib/utils` `cn` helper exists and Tailwind/shadcn tokens (e.g., `bg-background`, `border-input`) are configured.
- Dependencies to install in the React app: `@radix-ui/react-select`, `@radix-ui/react-icons`.
- Minor correctness fix in the pasted Select: ensure this class name is exactly as provided in your original snippet:
  - `max-h-[min(24rem,var(--radix-select-content-available-height))]` (avoid the typo `max-h=[min(...)]`).

**Risks / Follow-ups**
- RTL: current CSS uses physical `right`; if RTL is required, consider logical properties in a follow-up.
- High-contrast/forced colors: optionally hide the chevron image in forced-colors mode to avoid visibility issues.

**Verdict**
- Approve. The Angular build blocker is addressed (`onTouched` is public), and the selector redesign is centralized, minimal, and meets requirements. React/shadcn component is ready to add when a React app exists (with the noted class fix).
