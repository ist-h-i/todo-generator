**Summary**
- Scope is tight and appropriate: increased per-item role length to 200 on both backend and Angular UI without unrelated refactors. DB uses JSON for `roles`, so no migration is needed.
- Implementation matches the plan and resolves the reported error message case for 32 chars.

**Backend Review**
- Validation: `_MAX_ROLE_LENGTH` set to 200 and enforced in `parse_roles`; error message reflects the limit.
  - backend/app/services/profile.py:15 sets `_MAX_ROLE_LENGTH = 200`
  - backend/app/services/profile.py:161 enforces length and emits: 業務内容は1項目あたり200文字以内で入力してください。
- Routing: Update path uses server-side `parse_roles`.
  - backend/app/routers/profile.py:42
- Schema/DB: `roles` is `JSON`, not length-constrained; no DB change needed.
  - backend/app/models.py:53

Observations:
- No other 32-char limits linked to roles found; unrelated `String(32)` columns exist (e.g., `subject_type`, `generation_status`).
- Counting semantics unchanged (Python `len`), which is acceptable and minimal.

**Frontend Review**
- Max length constant updated; both validator and maxlength binding use 200.
  - frontend/src/app/core/profile/profile-dialog.ts:308 `MAX_CUSTOM_ROLE_LENGTH = 200`
  - frontend/src/app/core/profile/profile-dialog.html:329 `[attr.maxlength]="maxCustomRoleLength"`
- UI helper text reflects 200 and is consistent.
  - frontend/src/app/core/profile/profile-dialog.html:351 “最大{{ maxCustomRoleLength }}文字…”

Observations:
- UI error for custom input uses “担当領域…文字以内…”, while backend uses “業務内容…文字以内…”. Both are understandable; consider aligning terminology if preferred.
- Predefined role values are well below 200, so backend limit won’t reject legit selections.

**Correctness & Edge Cases**
- Accepts 200 and rejects >200 on both layers for custom entries.
- Deduplication and maximum items (10) unaffected.
- No data loss risk; DB widening unnecessary due to JSON storage.

**Tests**
- Existing tests cover roles array behavior and count limit; there is no boundary test for 200-char items. Recommend adding:
  - Server test: 200-char role passes; 201-char role fails with 422 and expected JA message (backend/tests/test_profile.py).
- Frontend has no unit test for custom-role 200-char boundary; optional to add, but not required for this change.

**Nitpicks / Suggestions (Lightweight)**
- Consistency: If product language prefers a single term, align “業務内容” vs “担当領域” in UI copy to match backend or vice versa. Not functionally required.
- Error surfacing: On submission 422 errors, the component shows a generic error. Optionally parse and show the server’s specific message in `roleErrorStore` for better UX. Keep scope minimal unless requested.

**Residual Risks / Open Questions**
- Unicode counting uses default string length (code units/code points). If strict grapheme-aware counting is required, it would need additional logic on both layers.
- Downstream consumers (search/export) relying on 32-char assumptions were not found; if any exist outside this repo, they should be reviewed.

**Verdict**
- Changes are correct, minimal, and consistent with requirements. Ship as-is, with optional boundary tests and terminology alignment as follow-ups if desired.
