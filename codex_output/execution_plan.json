    "notes": "Angular + Tailwind + TS already present. React/shadcn/Radix integration is not suitable. The new CSS in frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss modernizes selects and vertically centers the trigger icon. Minimal work: ensure all <select> use class \"form-control app-select\", keep CSS, and document usage. No new dependencies.",
    "tests": "Manual checks: 1) Verify selects across Settings, Reports, Analyze, Board, Admin pages render with centered chevron, adequate right padding, and consistent radius. 2) Hover/focus states show border/ring and subtle shadow; disabled state dims and locks cursor. 3) Dark mode: check chevron visibility, focus outline, and contrast. 4) Multi-selects: confirm chevrons are removed and layout is stable. 5) Mobile viewport: ensure no overflow and tap targets remain â‰¥44px."
