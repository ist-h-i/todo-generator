    "notes": "Leanest path: a single coder can implement migration, API, UI, and tests within 30 minutes. Add code_quality_reviewer to quickly sanity-check validation/i18n consistency and migration safety. Skip integrator/release_manager to keep cycle time minimal unless CI requires them.",
    "tests": "API: (1) POST /register without nickname -> 400 with i18n error key. (2) nickname length 1 -> 400; 33 -> 400. (3) valid nickname trims spaces and persists; response includes nickname. Migration: After migration, existing users have non-null nickname matching `user-{id}`; column is NOT NULL. UI: Registration form shows required Nickname; client blocks submit on empty/invalid; sends nickname in payload. i18n: EN/JA strings exist for label, placeholder, and validation messages."
