    "notes": "Make a single, centralized CSS change in frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss to replace the gradient-based caret with a single simple down-arrow (SVG data URI), keeping vertical centering and spacing intact. Do not alter Angular templates/TS. Provide React/shadcn select.tsx, demo.tsx, label.tsx as copy-paste files and setup instructions (components under /components/ui, ensure @ alias and cn util, install @radix-ui/react-select and @radix-ui/react-icons) for React projects. Explain why /components/ui is important for shadcn.",
    "tests": "Manual: in Angular app, open Settings, Board, Reports pages. Verify the select trigger shows a single minimalist down-arrow, vertically centered, with adequate right padding. Check states (default/hover/focus-visible/disabled), multi-select/size>1 (no caret), and light/dark parity. For React deliverables, confirm the files compile in a React+Tailwind+TS project with @ alias and that the demo renders with ChevronDown icon."
