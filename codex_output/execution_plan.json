    "notes": "Run the existing idempotent generator to create only missing per-class/component recipes under docs/recipes/classes mirroring frontend/src/app. Avoid overwrites. If the script is unavailable or misses edge cases (e.g., export default class), seed only those few stubs manually to keep the diff small and contained.",
    "tests": "1) Verify generator exists: `ls -l scripts/generate_class_recipes.py`. 2) Generate: `python scripts/generate_class_recipes.py`. 3) Idempotency: re-run and confirm `git status --porcelain` is empty. 4) Coverage sanity: compare counts `rg -n \"^export\\s+(default\\s+)?class\\s+\\w+\" frontend/src/app | wc -l` vs `rg --files docs/recipes/classes/frontend/src/app | rg '\\\\.recipe\\\\.md$' | wc -l`. 5) Spot-check a component and a service for created recipe files under mirrored paths and basic content structure."
