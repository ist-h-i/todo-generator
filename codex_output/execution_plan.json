    "notes": "Implement a minimal, shared fix in UiSelectComponent by deferring initial option read and observing projected <option> changes with MutationObserver. No API or template changes. This should restore the level options and stabilize other selects within the time cap.",
    "tests": "Manual: (1) Admin → コンピテンシーを登録 → verify two level options render and selection persists; (2) Admin → 判定と履歴 → both user and competency selects populate and are selectable; (3) Reports page → status/priority selects show options. Optional unit test (time-permitting): shallow-mount UiSelect with projected options added after init; assert panel options length updates after MutationObserver triggers."
