    "notes": "Coder implements minimal channel model, membership, card.channel_id, scoped queries, and small UI additions (channel select on card create, simple filter). Integrator runs migrations, wires config, and verifies endpoints/UI load. Owner/member role kept minimal; invites by username auto-join. Existing cards backfilled to creator’s private channel.",
    "tests": "Backend: (1) Create card with invalid channel → 403. (2) Create card in member channel → 201, channelId stored. (3) List cards returns only member-channel cards. (4) Invite adds membership; invitee can list/create. (5) Leave removes membership; access revoked. (6) Kick by owner removes member; member loses access. UI: (1) Card create shows channel dropdown with default. (2) Creating a card without changing selection succeeds. (3) Switching channel filter changes visible cards. Migration: After migration, existing cards have non-null channel_id and are visible in private channel."
