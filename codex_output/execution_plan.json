    "notes": "Single-stage (coder) is sufficient to add a service + host component, CSS animations, and wire into the app with a minimal diff. No new deps or refactors. If an existing toast system exists, coder will adapt to extend it instead of replacing.",
    "tests": "Add unit tests for ToastService: (1) newest-first order, (2) per-severity durations and sticky error, (3) loading returns id and persists until dismiss/update, (4) dismissal triggers exit state then removal. Manual QA: visually confirm right-side stack, colors/shadows per severity, timers (10s/5s/sticky), slide-in/out animations, and close behavior."
