    "notes": "Add a Quick Links block to README and remove/move any coding-rule text if found. Given current repo, README contains no explicit rules; expect an additive Quick Links change only. If any rule-like lines are discovered, merge them into the Angular or Governance docs without duplication.",
    "tests": "1) Link check: verify README links to docs/governance/development-governance-handbook.md, docs/guidelines/angular-coding-guidelines.md, docs/ui-design-system.md, docs/ui-layout-requirements.md. 2) Grep README for rule keywords (e.g., 'must', 'do not', 'coding', 'guideline', 'lint', 'style', 'naming', 'design tokens') and confirm no prescriptive rules remain. 3) Quick skim of modified docs to ensure headings remain coherent and no duplicate guidance was introduced."
