    "notes": "Centralize the fix by adjusting select hover styles in frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss to stop the background from turning white. Align hover behavior with inputs: keep subtle border/box-shadow feedback, remove or reduce hover background lightening in both light and dark themes. No TS/template changes, no new deps, retain currentColor chevron.",
    "tests": "Build the frontend and manually verify on Settings, Board, and Reports pages that: (1) hover background no longer turns white; (2) focus-visible ring and disabled states remain correct; (3) dark mode remains readable; (4) caret icon color matches text (currentColor) and remains visible; (5) no regressions for multi-select/size>1."
