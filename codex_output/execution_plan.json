    "notes": "Implement a centralized SCSS-only update: extend .app-select styles to also target select.form-control and increase right padding + caret offset for modern spacing. No template or behavioral changes. Preserve tokens, dark mode, and focus states. Risk: minor visual changes for selects previously inheriting plain .form-control styling.",
    "tests": "Build frontend and visually verify selectors on Settings, Board, and Reports pages. Confirm caret spacing, hover/focus/disabled states, dark-mode variants, multi-select behavior (no caret), and keyboard focus. Spot-check any selects lacking .app-select or .form-control usage."
