    "notes": "Move hover/toast stack from top-right to bottom-right with minimal CSS changes. Keep newest-on-top ordering and existing animations. No service or API changes. Verify safe-area padding and z-index.",
    "tests": "Manual: trigger warning/notice/system/loading toasts and confirm container is bottom-right, newest on top, entry drop-in and exit slide-right animations unchanged, timers behave per severity. Mobile: confirm safe-area inset prevents clipping; verify no overlap with bottom UI elements. Error: ensure it remains persistent at bottom-right until programmatically dismissed."
