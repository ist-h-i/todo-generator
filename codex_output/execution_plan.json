    "notes": "Coder inventories docs/recipes, maps each recipe to its source directory, moves files and any local assets, updates all internal links and docs navigation/configs, runs docs build/link-checks, and removes the centralized folder. Risks: hidden hardcoded paths, ambiguous mapping, asset path breakage. If ambiguity arises, coder uses a pointer stub and flags for follow-up.",
    "tests": "1) Run docs build (e.g., `npm run docs:build` or repo-specific) and ensure success. 2) Run link checker if available (e.g., `npm run docs:check-links`). 3) Search for old path references: `rg -n \"docs/recipes\"` -> expect no matches. 4) Open a few key indices and ensure links resolve to co-located recipes."
