    "notes": "Implement a single centralized SCSS change in frontend/src/styles/pages/_base.scss to unify native <select> with inputs: keep background consistent on hover (no white), ensure the chevron icon is always visible and uses currentColor, preserve focus/disabled states and dark mode. Apply rules to both .app-select and select.form-control. If needed, set the shared Angular ui-select trigger icon color to currentColor and remove hover-only visibility. Do not introduce React/shadcn; the repo is Angular.",
    "tests": "Build frontend and visually verify: (1) selector hover bg matches inputs (no white) in light/dark; (2) icon visible at rest and matches text via currentColor; (3) focus-visible ring and disabled styles match inputs; (4) multi/size>1 variants hide caret correctly; (5) check across pages using .app-select and select.form-control (e.g., Settings, Board, Reports)."
