    "notes": "Single-stage (coder) is sufficient to add a central HoverMessageService and a lightweight host component, wire it into the app shell, and route notifications through it. No new dependencies; CSS-only animations. If an existing notification system exists, coder will extend/adapt it instead of replacing to keep the diff minimal.",
    "tests": "Unit: verify queue order (newest first), per-severity durations (error sticky, warning 10s, notice 5s, system >=3s), loading returns id and persists until dismiss/update, dismissal triggers exit flag then removal after ~200â€“300ms. Manual: confirm right-side stack, slide-in entry and slide-out-right exit, colors/shadows per severity, timers behave as specified, errors and loading persist until explicitly dismissed/updated."
