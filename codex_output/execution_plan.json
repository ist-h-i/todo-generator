    "notes": "Minimize edits by only widening the two profile fields: a single DB migration (expand to 200), bump server- and client-side validators to 200, and update localized error/help text. Deploy migration first, then API, then SPA. Watch for length-dependent indexes and keep counting semantics consistent with current implementation.",
