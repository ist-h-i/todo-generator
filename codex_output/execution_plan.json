    "notes": "Angular app confirmed. Fix dark-mode caret by having UiSelectComponentâ€™s icon inherit text color: set `.ui-select__icon { color: currentColor; }`. Global native <select> already uses stroke='currentColor', so no change needed. Do not introduce React/shadcn; if a React sub-app is ever added, default to `components/ui` and `lib/utils` per shadcn conventions.",
    "tests": "1) ng build production. 2) In dark mode, open pages that use UiSelect and native <select>; verify the down-arrow matches the text color across default/hover/focus/disabled. 3) Sanity-check light mode for regressions."
