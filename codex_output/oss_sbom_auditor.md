**Dependency Inventory**

- Frontend (npm):
  - Runtime: Angular 20 (@angular/*), RxJS 7.8, tslib 2.8, zone.js 0.15
  - Dev: Angular CLI/build, TypeScript 5.9, ESLint 9 + @typescript-eslint 8, Karma/Jasmine, Puppeteer, TailwindCSS/PostCSS, esbuild, patch-package
- Backend (Python):
  - Runtime: fastapi, uvicorn[standard], SQLAlchemy, pydantic, pydantic-settings, email-validator, alembic, python-multipart, httpx, google-generativeai, Pillow, Jinja2, cryptography
  - Dev/QA: pytest, black, ruff, coverage

**License Review**

- Frontend transitive licenses (from package-lock) are predominantly permissive: MIT, Apache-2.0, ISC, BSD-2/3. No GPL/AGPL detected in the lockfile sample.
- Likely permissive licenses for Python stack:
  - fastapi (MIT), uvicorn (BSD-3), SQLAlchemy (MIT), pydantic/pydantic-settings (MIT), email-validator (MIT), alembic (MIT), python-multipart (Apache-2.0), httpx (BSD-3), google-generativeai (Apache-2.0), Pillow (HPND-derived, permissive), Jinja2 (BSD-3), cryptography (Apache-2.0/BSD).
- Project-level licensing:
  - No root LICENSE file found; frontend/package.json lacks a “license” field. Distribution terms for the project are currently undefined.
- Frontend build licensing:
  - Angular production builds typically extract third-party licenses by default; development config disables extraction (expected). Verify production license extraction in CI artifacts.

**Security/Policy Observations**

- google-generativeai: permissive license, but API usage subject to Google service terms; ensure ToS compliance and data handling policies are documented.
- patch-package modifies Karma; ensure patches are reviewed, pinned, and do not alter upstream license notices.
- Puppeteer downloads Chromium during postinstall (dev-only); ensure deterministic, pinned versions, and acceptable use in CI.
- No automated license/SBOM generation configured; no automated license policy gate detected.
- No evidence of strong copyleft or commercial-only licenses in manifests; further transitive verification recommended via SBOM tooling.

**Actions**

- Add a project LICENSE at repo root and declare `license` in frontend/package.json to define distribution terms.
- Generate and store SBOMs:
  - Frontend: CycloneDX (e.g., @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm) or `license-checker` in CI; archive SPDX/CycloneDX.
  - Backend: `pip-audit -f cyclonedx` or `cyclonedx-py` for Python; archive alongside build artifacts.
- Add a CI license compliance gate:
  - Fail on GPL/AGPL/SSPL or unknown licenses per org policy; produce a Third-Party Notices artifact for releases.
- Verify Angular production license extraction and include third-party notices in release bundles.
- Document third-party service terms for google-generativeai; confirm data/PII handling aligns with internal policy.

No prohibitive licenses identified in the current manifests/lockfile sample. The primary compliance gap is the absence of a project LICENSE and automated SBOM/license reporting in CI.
