    "notes": "Lean route focused on a simple frontend UI relocation. Reuse existing templates/services; no backend changes. Review targets logic parity and UI/keyboard basics. Main risk: broken deep links and subtle layout shifts.",
    "tests": "- Navigate to Admin > コンピテンシー; verify Levels UI appears directly under competency registration.\n- Create a new level; see it listed; refresh and confirm persistence.\n- Edit and delete a level; confirm validation and error handling match previous behavior.\n- Confirm the Levels UI is absent from API・日次上限.\n- Verify i18n labels render; no console errors.\n- Keyboard test: Tab through controls in コンピテンシー; focus order remains logical.\n- If E2E exists: update selectors to new section and run affected specs."
