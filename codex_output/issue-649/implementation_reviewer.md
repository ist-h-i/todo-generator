**Summary**
- The Competency Level management UI has been moved under the コンピテンシー tab and removed from API・日次上限. No business logic changes detected.

**What I Reviewed**
- Template relocation and absence of duplication.
- Form/control bindings and method references.
- Component logic for levels and dependencies.

**Findings**
- Levels section appears under コンピテンシー with list + create form intact: frontend/src/app/features/admin/feature/admin-page.component.html:205.
- Old Levels section is removed from API・日次上限; only API key and default limits remain: frontend/src/app/features/admin/feature/admin-page.component.html:468.
- All bindings resolve to existing component members:
  - `competencyLevels()`, `competencyLevelForm`, `createCompetencyLevel()`, `competencyLevelScaleOptions`, `loading()` exist and match usage: frontend/src/app/features/admin/feature/admin-page.component.ts:72,129,315,194,54.
- Competency form still uses level select fed by `competencyLevelSelectOptions()`: frontend/src/app/features/admin/feature/admin-page.component.html:124.
- Unit tests do not hardcode section placement; unaffected: frontend/src/app/features/admin/feature/admin-page.component.spec.ts:1.

**Standards & Scope Check**
- Frontend-only change; minimal template edits; no TS service or model changes.
- i18n/labels are consistent; semantic structure (<section>/<header>/<h2>) preserved.
- Angular control flow (`@if`, `@for`) usage is consistent with the file.

**Residual Risks**
- Deep links or docs pointing to the old API・日次上限 location will no longer land on the Levels section.
- Minor layout or focus-order shifts under コンピテンシー due to new context.
- E2E/analytics selectors (if any) targeting the old DOM location will need updating.

**Open Questions**
- Do you want a short notice or link left in API・日次上限 pointing users to コンピテンシー, or is full removal correct?
- Any preference on the exact placement order within コンピテンシー (it’s currently after “コンピテンシーを登録”)?

**Suggestions**
- If there are E2E tests or analytics tied to the old section, update selectors to target the new コンピテンシーレベル section.
- Consider adding an anchor id to the new section for future deep links if needed (e.g., `id="competency-levels"`).
