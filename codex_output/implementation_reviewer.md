**CI/Release Readiness**

- Build: Angular app compiles; change is template-only. No new deps. `ng build` remains valid via `frontend/package.json`.
- Tests: CI runs frontend Karma tests and backend pytest (tests.yml). No board-specific specs exist; template change unlikely to break tests.
- Lint/Format: ESLint workflow covers frontend (lint.yml). Prettier config present; format checks available via `npm run format:check` but not enforced in CIâ€”optional to add.
- Security Scans: Secret scan and dependency audit workflows exist; change does not impact them.

**Change Verification**

- Targeted update implemented at `frontend/src/app/features/board/page.html:261`.
  - Container now `flex flex-col items-start gap-2`; `justify-between` removed.
  - DOM order: status (`{{ column.title }}`) above content (`{{ subtask.title }}`).
- Scoped to board subtask card section; no other occurrences of the old class across `frontend/`.

**Deployment**

- No dedicated deploy workflow detected. Current pipelines validate build/tests; release remains project-standard (manual or existing infra).
- Frontend artifact generation unchanged; backend unaffected.

**Monitoring**

- No monitoring config changed. UI-only layout change; no telemetry impact.
- Recommend a quick post-deploy smoke check on the board route across viewports.

**Rollback**

- Safe to revert via Git (single-file HTML change). No migrations/config involved.

**Risks & Mitigations**

- Card height increase could affect DnD hit areas or virtualization: perform a manual drag/drop sanity check post-deploy.
- Older Safari flex-gap: app already uses flex `gap`; if supporting legacy Safari, consider minimal local fallback later (non-blocking).
- Formatting drift: run `npm run format:check` to avoid noise in future PRs.

**Recommended CI Steps (manual/local)**

- `cd frontend && npm ci && npm run lint && npm run test:ci && npm run build`
- Backend unchanged; optional: `pytest backend/tests` if running full pipeline.

Overall: Ready for merge and release. CI should pass as-is; rollback is trivial.
