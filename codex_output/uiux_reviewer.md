**UI/UX Findings**

- Type safety uplift reduces runtime surprises, improving stability and perceived quality.
- Current approach (typed DTOs + guards) enables consistent rendering of lists, forms, and error states.
- Angular template `$any(...)` casts can mask typing issues that surface as brittle interactions (e.g., form inputs), impacting UX reliability.
- Sanitization at unsafe boundaries supports resilient flows; ensure user-facing fallbacks exist for invalid data.
- No direct UI copy/visual changes; benefits are indirect (fewer broken states, clearer contracts).

**Interaction Flow Checks**

- Forms
  - Use typed reactive forms; avoid `$any` casts in templates to reduce brittle event handling.
  - On submit: disable actions, show progress, prevent duplicate submits, re-enable with clear inline errors.
- Data loading
  - For lists/detail pages, show skeletons or optimistic placeholders tied to typed states (idle/loading/success/error).
  - Empty states: provide clear guidance and primary action (e.g., “Add first item”).
- Errors
  - Map guard/adaptor failures to friendly messages and non-PII logs; avoid generic “Something went wrong.”
  - Keep retry affordances near the error context (inline retry for sections, not global only).
- Navigation
  - Preserve user context on recoverable errors; avoid hard redirects when a typed boundary fails.
  - Use typed route params and guards to prevent landing on broken views.
- Accessibility
  - Ensure validation errors use `aria-describedby`, focus the first error on submit, and maintain visible contrast.
  - Announce loading and error states via live regions when content changes.

**Recommendations**

- Reduce template `$any(...)` usage by moving casts into component code with typed event handlers; improves maintainability and interaction reliability.
- Standardize UI state modeling: define a lightweight, typed “ViewState” (loading/success/error/empty) per feature to drive consistent spinners, empty states, and error displays.
- Establish microcopy conventions for errors and empty states (short, action-oriented, non-technical).
- Add a short PR checklist line: “Typed forms/events, clear loading/error states, accessible validation.”
- Consider a follow-up to lint `$any` in templates (warn) to prevent regressions without disrupting current scope.

**Risk Notes**

- Overuse of assertion chains to bypass the `any` ban can still cause brittle interactions; prefer guards with user-friendly fallbacks.
- If third‑party SDKs leak untyped data into the UI, contain them behind typed adapters to avoid inconsistent UI states.
